Web Editor allows you to create, update, and publish docs directly in Mintlify with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. 

All Mintlify components are available in the Web Editor with a slash command.

## Git basics
While Web Editor means you don’t need to go to GitHub or your command line to make changes, it’s still helpful to know the basics of git.

Git terminology:

- **Repository**: A storage space where your code lives. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (like GitHub or GitLab).
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development. It's a working copy of the code that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main version.
- **Pull request:** A request to merge changes from a working branch into the main branch. This is used for reviewing content before making changes live.

 The translation from Web Editor to git terminology is:

- “Create a branch” = create a new branch
- “Save changes” = create a commit
- “Publish” = create a pull request (if you aren’t on the main branch)

## How to create and publish an edit

The general flow you’ll be following with Web Editor is:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set up connection">
    If you haven’t done so, set up your initial connection to your repository (see [Quickstart](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart))
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a new branch">
    In the top left corner, click on the branch icon to create a new branch.
    This will be your working branch to make changes. Give it a short but descriptive title, e.g. tiffany-adding-editor-page. 
    <Tip> As a best practice, you should always create a new branch to make changes so you can submit a Pull Request for review by other teammates. You also may not have permissions to make changes to the main branch. </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make content changes">
    The “Changes” dropdown in the navigation bar keeps track of all the files you have changed in this working session. You can also discard changes with this dropdown. 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Save changes">
    If you want to save the changes you’ve made so far, click “Save changes,” which will create a commit.1. This saves a snapshot of your current work, including details of what was changed, as part of your working branch. You can revisit or undo these changes later if needed in GitHub. Once you “Save changes”, the “Changes” dropdown will reset. 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Submit for review">
    When you are ready to submit your content for review, hitting “publish” in the top right corner will create a pull request for review by other teammates. Add a description of your changes to help expedite the review process. 
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing modes

If at any point you are having difficulty making content edits, you can also switch into a different editing mode and edit the source file directly. 

In the navigation bar, there are three different options for viewing the Web Editor.

- **Visual Editor**: This is the WYSIWYG experience to edit. It’ll show content exactly how it’ll appear in your final docs.
- **Source Editor**: This will show the file in markdown format.
- **Diff View:** This will show the differences between what you’re working on and the latest version that you have committed, in markdown format. The diff view will reset once you save changes or make a pull request.
