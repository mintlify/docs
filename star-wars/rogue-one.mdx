---

**Rogue one** (2016) is the first standalone Star Wars film, telling the story directly before *A new hope*. Directed by Gareth Edwards, the film reveals how the Rebel Alliance obtained the Death Star plans that set the original trilogy in motion.

## Plot

Jyn Erso, daughter of the Death Star's reluctant designer, joins a group of Rebel spies on a daring mission to steal the plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon. Their sacrifice makes the events of *A new hope* possible.

## The Rogue One crew

- **Jyn Erso**: A criminal with a personal connection to the Death Star
- **Cassian Andor**: A dedicated Rebel intelligence officer
- **K-2SO**: A reprogrammed Imperial droid with a sarcastic personality
- **Chirrut Îmwe**: A blind warrior-monk devoted to the Force
- **Baze Malbus**: A heavily armed mercenary and Chirrut's friend
- **Bodhi Rook**: A defected Imperial pilot

## Unique approach

Unlike other Star Wars films, *Rogue one* is a war film that shows the gritty sacrifice of ordinary people fighting against impossible odds. The film has a darker, more grounded tone than the main saga films.

## Connections to A new hope

The film ends moments before *A new hope* begins, showing:
- How Princess Leia obtained the Death Star plans
- The vulnerability in the Death Star that Luke exploits
- The fate of the brave rebels who made it all possible

## Notable elements

- Darth Vader's terrifying hallway scene
- Digital recreation of Grand Moff Tarkin
- The Battle of Scarif
- Cameos from original trilogy characters
