**Revenge of the Sith** (2003) is the darkest and most emotionally powerful film in the prequel trilogy. Directed by George Lucas, it chronicles Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader and the destruction of the Jedi Order.

## Plot

Three years into the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker rescue the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine. As the war reaches its climax, Anakin's fear of loss and manipulation by Palpatine lead him to embrace the dark side, becoming Darth Vader and helping to destroy the Jedi.

## Key events

- The Battle of Coruscant
- Anakin's fall to the dark side
- Order 66 and the Great Jedi Purge
- The duel on Mustafar between Obi-Wan and Anakin
- The birth of Luke and Leia
- The rise of the Empire

## Emotional core

The film's power comes from watching the good-hearted Anakin transform into the villain we know from the original trilogy. His relationship with Obi-Wan and his desire to save Padmé drive his tragic choices.

## Connections to original trilogy

- How Anakin became Darth Vader
- The birth of Luke and Leia
- The survival of Obi-Wan and Yoda
- The construction of the Death Star
