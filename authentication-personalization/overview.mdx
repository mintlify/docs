Choose from three approaches to manage access and customize your documentation based on user information and your security needs:

- **Full authentication**: Complete privacy protection for all content with full content customization.
- **Partial authentication**: Page-by-page access control with full content customization.
- **Personalization**: Content customization with **no security guarantees**. All content remains publicly accessible.

### Use case examples

**Choose full authentication when:**
- Building internal company documentation that contains sensitive information
- Documenting proprietary APIs that require user verification
- Creating customer-specific implementation guides

**Choose partial authentication when:**
- Offering public getting-started guides with private advanced features
- Publishing open-source docs with private enterprise sections

**Choose personalization when:**
- Creating public API documentation that shows user-specific examples
- Building marketing sites that customize content based on user profiles
- Offering public tutorials that adapt to user preferences or skill levels

## Handshake methods

Choose the method that best fits your existing infrastructure and security requirements.

| Method | Available for | Setup complexity | Best for |
|:-------|:--------------|:-----------------|:----------|
| **JWT** | All approaches | Medium | Custom login flows, maximum security control |
| **OAuth 2.0** | All approaches | High | Third-party auth providers, enterprise security |
| **Mintlify Dashboard** | Authentication only | Low | Teams already using Mintlify dashboard |
| **Password** | Authentication only | Low | Simple shared access without personalization |
| **Shared Session** | Personalization only | Low | Apps with existing session-based auth |

### When to use each method

**JWT**: Use when you have an existing authentication system and want full control over the login flow. Ideal for custom user management or when you need to decouple documentation access from your main application.

**OAuth 2.0**: Use when you want to leverage third-party authentication providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) or need enterprise-grade security standards. Best for organizations already using OAuth infrastructure.

**Mintlify Dashboard**: Use when your documentation editors are also your documentation readers. Perfect for internal teams who already manage content through the Mintlify dashboard.

**Password**: Use for simple access control when you don't need to track individual users or personalize content. Good for contractors, beta users, or temporary access scenarios.

**Shared Session**: Use when you want seamless login between your application and documentation. Ideal when users are already authenticated in your main application and you want to personalize their documentation experience.

## Content customization

All three approaches support content personalization features including dynamic MDX content, API key prefilling, and page visibility controls. For detailed implementation guidance, see [Personalization setup](/deploy/personalization-setup).
