Partial authentication lets you protect private documentation while keeping other pages publicly viewable. Users can browse public content freely and authenticate only when accessing protected pages.

Partial authentication shares all the same features as authentication, but with the ability to allow unauthenticated users to view certain pages.

## Setup

Follow the [Authentication Setup](/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup) guide and select **Partial Authentication** when configuring your chosen handshake method.

## Making pages public

By default, all pages are protected. Add the `public` property to the page's frontmatter to make it viewable without authentication:

```mdx
---
title: "My Page"
public: true
---
```
