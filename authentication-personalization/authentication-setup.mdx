Authentication requires users to log in before accessing your documentation. This guide covers setup for each available handshake method.

**Need help choosing?** See the [overview](/authentication-personalization/overview) to compare options.

<Info>
  Authentication methods are available on the [Growth and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication). Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for more information.

  <Tab title="JWT">
### Prerequisites

 * An authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs.
 * A backend service that can create redirect URLs.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **JWT**.
    4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
    5. Select **Generate new key**.
    6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate Mintlify authentication into your login flow.">
    Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user authentication:
    
    * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.
    * Sign the JWT with your secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm.
    * Create a redirect URL back to the `/login/jwt-callback` path of your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example
Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` with an existing authentication system at `foo.com`. You want to extend your login flow to grant access to the docs.

To do this, create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that extends your existing authentication.

After verifying user credentials:
* Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
* Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000), // 2 week session expiration
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    content: {
      firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
      lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s') // 10 second JWT expiration
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#${jwt}`);
}
```

```python Python
import jwt # pyjwt
import os

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

private_key = os.getenv(MINTLIFY_JWT_PEM_SECRET_NAME, '')

@router.get('/auth')
async def return_mintlify_auth_status(current_user):
  jwt_token = jwt.encode(
    payload={
      'exp': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)).timestamp()),    # 10 second JWT expiration
      'expiresAt': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)).timestamp()), # 1 week session expiration
      'groups': ['admin'] if current_user.is_admin else [],
      'content': {
        'firstName': current_user.first_name,
        'lastName': current_user.last_name,
      },
    },
    key=private_key,
    algorithm='EdDSA'
  )

  return RedirectResponse(url=f'https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{jwt_token}', status_code=302)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Redirecting unauthenticated users

When an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, their intended destination is automatically preserved:

1. User attempts to visit a protected page: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart`.
2. Redirect to your login URL with a redirect query parameter: `https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart`.
3. After authentication, redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback?redirect=%2Fquickstart#{SIGNED_JWT}`.
4. User lands in their original destination.

<Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
### Prerequisites

- You have an existing OAuth server that supports the Authorization Code flow.
    - You can create a new API endpoint that can be accessed by the returned OAuth access token.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication), select the OAuth option, and fill out the required fields:

    - **Authorization URL**: The base URL for the authorization request, to which we will add the appropriate query parameters.
    - **Client ID**: An ID for the OAuth 2.0 client to be used.
    - **Scopes**: An array of scopes that will be requested. TODO: clarify why there could be multiple
    - **Token URL**: The base URL for the token exchange request.
    - **Info API URL** (optional): The endpoint that will be hit to retrieve user info. If omitted, the OAuth flow will only be used to verify identity, and the user info will be empty.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth client">
    Copy the Redirect URL listed in the [Mintlify authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add it as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your Info API (Optional)">
    If you want to take advantage of authentication's customization features, you'll need to create an endpoint to retrieve info about your users.
    Create an API endpoint that can be accessed with an OAuth access token, and responds with a JSON payload following the [User](../sending-data) format.

    Return to your [Mintlify authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add the Info API URL
    to your OAuth configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I have an existing OAuth server that supports the Authorization Code flow. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create an endpoint `api.foo.com/docs/user-info` which requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope, and responds with the user's custom data according to Mintlifyâ€™s specification.

I then go to the dashboard settings, navigate to the Authentication settings, select OAuth, and enter the relevant values for the OAuth flow and Info API endpoint:
- **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
- **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
- **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
- **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
- **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

Finally, I copy the Redirect URL displayed in the dashboard settings and add it as an authorized redirect URL in my OAuth client configuration settings.

<Tab title="Mintlify Dashboard">
### Prerequisites

- Your documentation readers are also your documentation editors.

### Implementation

### Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I want my docs
to be internal, and the people that will be viewing my docs are the same people that
contribute to my docs.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I can go to my [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication)
and enable Authentication with the Mintlify Auth Handshake.

I can then ensure that anyone that should be able to read the docs has been added as a user in
my [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and select
    the Mintlify Auth Handshake.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add users">
    Ensure that any users that should be able to view your documentation have
    been added as users in your [Mintlify dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
  </Step>
</Steps>


  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Password">
<Info>
Password authentication is used for access control only. Does not allow for personalizaiton.
</Info>

### Prerequisites

- Your security requirements allow for password sharing between documentation readers.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a password">
    Go to your [dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and create
    a password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share your password">
    Securely share the password with your documentation readers. That's it!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I don't want
to have to keep track of who can and cannot access the docs. My main use case for
authentication is to prevent competitors from snooping - password sharing is secure
enough for my team.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my Mintlify dashboard and add at
least one password. I then share that password, along with the private docs URL,
with potential customers.
