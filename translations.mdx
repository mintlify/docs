## Overview

Mintlify allows you to automatically translate your documentation using AI, maintaining the original structure, formatting, and links of your original content. It integrates seamlessly with Mintlify's [languages](/navigation#languages) feature.

## Prerequisites

1. You must have a Growth, Pro, or Enterprise plan, and have purchased the translation add-on for the language you wish to have your documentation automatically translated to.
2. You must be using GitHub as your repository provider for your documentation content.
3. The 'base language' of your documentation must be English.
4. You must have a valid `docs.json` file in your repository.
5. All content to be translated must be valid MDX content. Any invalid MDX will cause the translation to fail.

## Getting Started

It is recommended to begin with a complete translation of your documentation to each language. This will ensure that all content is translated to your target language(s), and will update your `docs.json` file automatically.

A 'complete translation' can be triggered by visiting the translations page in the [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/translations).

The result of a complete translation will be a new branch and pull request in the repository associated with your Mintlify project. Depending on the size of your documentation, a complete translation may take a while to complete, but the job should run to completion and provide you with a link to a pull request where you can review the changes.

<Info>
  An automated translation is stored under a directory named after the [language code](/navigation#languages) you have selected.
  
  Custom directory names are not supported at this time.
</Info>

If you have more than one language to translate to, repeat the process for each language, merging the created pull request for each language before moving on to the next.

## Ongoing Translations

Once a language is translated and present in your `docs.json` file, ongoing localization are automatically handled by the Mintlify translation service, so long as you maintain a valid subscription to the translation add-on for the language you are translating to.

The ongoing translation of a change looks like the following:

1. A member of your organization makes changes to the documentation in your repository.
2. A pull request is created in your repository with those changes, is reviewed, and merged.
3. The merging of the pull request triggers an ongoing translation job of the new changes.
4. The translation job will translate, remove, or create the required files in the target language(s) according to your subscriptions and `docs.json` file.
5. The translation job will create a new branch and pull request in your repository with the translated changes for every language you have subscribed to, which a member of your organization can review and merge.

Mintlify will never automatically publish the translated changes to your production instance, so you will need to merge the pull request to your deployment branch to see the changes live.

It is highly recommended you quickly review and merge the translated changes so that your localization(s) are kept in sync.

## Advice, and Tips

 - Preview translated changes using `mintlify dev` before merging the pull request to your deployment branch.
 - Review and merge pull requests with any translated changes quickly, or your localization(s) will fall out of sync.
 - Currently, automatic translations do not work well with manual changes to the localized files or the generated `docs.json` navigation tree(s). It is recommended to only make changes to the English content, and let the translation service handle the rest.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

<Accordion title="What content is translated?">
  The translation service translates all non-code, non-component content in your documentation. This includes text, links, titles and descriptions in frontmatter, component attributes and navigation labels.

  Code blocks, images, other media, and metadata are not translated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I update my translations manually?">
  If you need to make changes to your translations, it is recommended to do so in the pull request created by the translation service.
  
  Please be aware that these changes may be overwritten the next time the English version of the page is updated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my translation not working?">
  If you are experiencing issues with your translations, please ensure that you have a valid subscription to the translation add-on for the language you are translating to, and that both your content and `docs.json` file are valid.

  If you're still running into issues, please [contact support](mailto:support@mintlify.com).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are changes sometimes suggested in sections of files that haven't been changed?">
  The translation service currently operates at a page level, and will attempt to translate the entire content of a page when any change to it is made.

  This is to ensure that the translation is as accurate as possible, and to prevent you from having to manually update the localized files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The language I'd like to translate to is not listed.">
  Automatic translations supports all languages supported by the Mintlify [languages](/navigation#languages) feature.

  If the language you'd like to translate to is not listed, please [contact support](mailto:support@mintlify.com) and we'll be happy to assist.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'd like to specify certain words or phrases to be not be translated, or translated differently.">
  Currently the translation service does not support specifying certain words or phrases to be translated differently, but we are working on adding this feature in the future!
