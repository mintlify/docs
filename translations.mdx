## Overview

You can automatically translate your documentation into multiple languages while maintaining structure, formatting, and links with AI. Translations integrate with the [languages](/navigation#languages) feature, allowing readers to switch between available languages in your documentation.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a Growth, Pro, or Enterprise plan with purchased translation add-ons for your target languages.
- You must be using GitHub as your repository provider for your documentation content.
- Your documentation must use English as a base language.
- You must have a valid `docs.json` file in your repository.
- All content to be translated must use valid `MDX` formatting. Any invalid `MDX` will cause the translation to fail.

## Getting Started

Start with a complete translation of your documentation into each of your preferred languages. This approach ensures complete coverage in each language and automatically updates your `docs.json` file.

You can initiate a complete translation from the translations page in your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/translations).

1. Select **Start translation**.
2. Select the first language that you want to translate your content to and then select **Start translation**.
3. The translation process will create a new branch and pull request in your Mintlify project repository with the translated content. Larger documentation sets may take longer to process.
4. Review the pull request and merge it.
5. Repeat the process for each language you want to translate to.

<Info>
  An automated translation is stored under a directory named after the [language code](/navigation#languages) that you have selected.
  
  Custom directory names for translations are not supported at this time.

## Ongoing Translations

After adding a translation to your `docs.json` file, any future changes to your documentation are automatically translated as long as you maintain a subscription to the translation add-on for your configured languages.

The ongoing translation process follows this sequence:

1. A member of your organization makes changes to the documentation in your repository.
2. Merging the pull request with their changes triggers an ongoing translation job.
3. The translation job translates, removes, or creates the required files in all subscribed languages based on your `docs.json` file.
4. For each subscribed language, the translation job creates a separate branch and pull request containing the translated changes for your review

Mintlify will never automatically publish translations to production. You must review and merge each translation pull request before the changes are live.

We recommended promptly reviewing and merging translation pull requests so that your localizations are kept in sync.

## Advice, and Tips

 - Preview translated changes using `mintlify dev` before merging the pull request to your deployment branch.
 - Review and merge pull requests with any translated changes quickly, or your localization(s) will fall out of sync.
 - Currently, automatic translations do not work well with manual changes to the localized files or the generated `docs.json` navigation tree(s). It is recommended to only make changes to the English content, and let the translation service handle the rest.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

<Accordion title="What content is translated?">
  The translation service translates all non-code, non-component content in your documentation. This includes text, links, titles and descriptions in frontmatter, component attributes and navigation labels.

  Code blocks, images, other media, and metadata are not translated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I update my translations manually?">
  If you need to make changes to your translations, it is recommended to do so in the pull request created by the translation service.
  
  Please be aware that these changes may be overwritten the next time the English version of the page is updated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my translation not working?">
  If you are experiencing issues with your translations, please ensure that you have a valid subscription to the translation add-on for the language you are translating to, and that both your content and `docs.json` file are valid.

  If you're still running into issues, please [contact support](mailto:support@mintlify.com).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are changes sometimes suggested in sections of files that haven't been changed?">
  The translation service currently operates at a page level, and will attempt to translate the entire content of a page when any change to it is made.

  This is to ensure that the translation is as accurate as possible, and to prevent you from having to manually update the localized files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The language I'd like to translate to is not listed.">
  Automatic translations supports all languages supported by the Mintlify [languages](/navigation#languages) feature.

  If the language you'd like to translate to is not listed, please [contact support](mailto:support@mintlify.com) and we'll be happy to assist.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'd like to specify certain words or phrases to be not be translated, or translated differently.">
  Currently the translation service does not support specifying certain words or phrases to be translated differently, but we are working on adding this feature in the future!
