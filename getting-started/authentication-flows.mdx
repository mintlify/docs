# Authentication flows

The Spotify Web API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Different flows are suitable for different application types. Choose the flow that best matches your use case.

## Available flows

## Authorization Code Flow

**Use case**: Web apps running on a server

The Authorization Code Flow is suitable for long-running applications where the user grants permission only once. It provides an access token that can be refreshed.

### Characteristics

- Returns an access token and refresh token
- Requires client secret (keep it secure on your server)
- Most secure flow for web applications
- Tokens can be refreshed without user interaction

### When to use

Use this flow when:
- You have a server-side application
- You can securely store the client secret
- You need long-term access to user data
- You want to refresh tokens automatically

## Authorization Code Flow with PKCE

**Use case**: Mobile, desktop, and single-page applications

PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is an OAuth 2.0 extension that provides additional security for applications that cannot keep a client secret secure.

### Characteristics

- Does not require client secret
- Returns an access token and refresh token
- More secure for public clients
- Uses a code verifier and challenge

### When to use

Use this flow when:
- Building a mobile or desktop application
- Creating a single-page application (SPA)
- You cannot securely store client secrets
- You need refresh tokens

## Client Credentials Flow

**Use case**: Server-to-server authentication

The Client Credentials Flow is used for server-to-server authentication. It doesn't require user permission or interaction.

### Characteristics

- No user authorization required
- Returns an access token (no refresh token)
- Can only access public Spotify data
- Token expires after a short period

### When to use

Use this flow when:
- You only need to access public Spotify data
- Your application doesn't require user-specific information
- Building server-side applications
- Creating background jobs or scripts

### Limitations

This flow cannot access user-specific endpoints like:
- Current user's playlists
- Saved tracks or albums
- Playback control
- User profile information

## Implicit Grant Flow (Deprecated)

<Warning>
The Implicit Grant Flow is deprecated. Use Authorization Code Flow with PKCE instead for client-side applications.
</Warning>

This flow was previously used for client-side applications but is now considered less secure. It returns an access token directly in the URL fragment, which can be exposed to potential attackers.

### Why it's deprecated

- Less secure than PKCE
- No refresh token support
- Token exposed in URL
- Not recommended by OAuth 2.0 best practices

## Comparison table

| Flow | Client Secret Required | Refresh Token | Use Case | Security |
|------|----------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Authorization Code | Yes | Yes | Server-side web apps | High |
| Authorization Code with PKCE | No | Yes | Mobile, desktop, SPAs | High |
| Client Credentials | Yes | No | Server-to-server | Medium |
| Implicit Grant | No | No | Legacy SPAs | Low (Deprecated) |

## Access token lifetime

All access tokens expire after a short period (typically 1 hour). Depending on the flow:

- **Authorization Code** and **PKCE**: Use refresh tokens to get new access tokens
- **Client Credentials**: Request a new token when the current one expires
- **Implicit Grant**: User must re-authenticate (deprecated)
