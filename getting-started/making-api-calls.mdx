# Making API calls

Once you have an access token, you can make requests to the Spotify Web API. This guide covers the basics of making API calls, handling responses, and following best practices.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://api.spotify.com/v1
```

## Request structure

Every API request must include an authorization header with your access token:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.spotify.com/v1/endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

### HTTP methods

The API uses standard HTTP methods:

- **GET**: Retrieve resources
- **POST**: Create new resources
- **PUT**: Update or replace resources
- **DELETE**: Remove resources

## Common parameters

Many endpoints accept these common query parameters:

<ParamField query="market" type="string">
  An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (e.g., "US", "GB", "DE"). Provides localized content and applies track relinking.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="limit" type="integer" default="20">
  Maximum number of items to return. Default and maximum values vary by endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="offset" type="integer" default="0">
  The index of the first item to return. Use with limit for pagination.
</ParamField>

## Example requests

### Get a track

Retrieve information about a single track:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/11dFghVXANMlKmJXsNCbNl" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

### Search for items

Search for tracks, albums, artists, or other content:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=remaster%20track:Doxy%20artist:Miles%20Davis&type=track" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

### Get user's playlists

Retrieve the current user's playlists (requires authentication):

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

<Note>
This endpoint requires the `playlist-read-private` scope.
</Note>

### Create a playlist

Create a new playlist for a user:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/{user_id}/playlists" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Playlist",
    "description": "My playlist description",
    "public": false
  }'
```

<Note>
This endpoint requires the `playlist-modify-private` scope.
</Note>

## Response format

The API returns responses in JSON format. Successful requests return:

- **200 OK**: Request succeeded (GET requests)
- **201 Created**: Resource created successfully (POST requests)
- **204 No Content**: Request succeeded with no response body (PUT/DELETE requests)

Example response:

```json
{
  "album": {
    "name": "Kind of Blue",
    "release_date": "1959-08-17"
  },
  "artists": [
    {
      "name": "Miles Davis",
      "id": "0kbYTNQb4Pb1rPbbaF0pT4"
    }
  ],
  "name": "So What",
  "duration_ms": 540000,
  "popularity": 75
}
```

## Pagination

Many endpoints return paginated results. The response includes:

<ResponseField name="href" type="string">
  Link to the current page
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="items" type="array">
  Array of requested items
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="limit" type="integer">
  Maximum number of items in response
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="next" type="string | null">
  URL to the next page (null if no more pages)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="offset" type="integer">
  Offset of items returned
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="previous" type="string | null">
  URL to the previous page (null if first page)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="total" type="integer">
  Total number of items available
</ResponseField>

Example paginated response:

```json
{
  "href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists?offset=0&limit=20",
  "items": [...],
  "limit": 20,
  "next": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists?offset=20&limit=20",
  "offset": 0,
  "previous": null,
  "total": 47
}
```

## Error handling

The API returns error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400 Bad Request">
    The request could not be understood. Check your parameters and request body.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
    Authentication failed or was not provided. Check your access token.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
    The request is understood but refused. You may not have the required scope.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="404 Not Found">
    The requested resource could not be found.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
    Rate limit exceeded. Check the `Retry-After` header for wait time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="500, 502, 503 Server Errors">
    Server-side error. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Error response format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "status": 401,
    "message": "Invalid access token"
  }
}
```

## Rate limits

The API uses rate limiting to protect service stability. Response headers include:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Rate limit ceiling for the endpoint
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)

When you receive a 429 error, check the `Retry-After` header for wait time in seconds.

<Tip>
Implement exponential backoff when retrying failed requests.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use batch endpoints">
    Retrieve multiple items in a single request using batch endpoints like `/albums` or `/tracks` with comma-separated IDs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Implement caching">
    Cache frequently accessed data that doesn't change often, like album metadata.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle errors gracefully">
    Implement proper error handling and retry logic for temporary failures.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respect rate limits">
    Monitor rate limit headers and implement backoff strategies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use appropriate scopes">
    Only request the scopes your application needs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
