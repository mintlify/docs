Use the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview documentation locally, view changes in real-time, and catch issues like broken links or accessibility problems. The CLI also includes utilities for renaming files, validating OpenAPI specs, and migrating content.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0+ (LTS versions recommended) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- Your documentation repository cloned locally

### Clone your repository

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate your repository">
  Find your repository on the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page:
    - `mintlify-community/docs-{org-name}-{id}` (Mintlify-hosted)
    - `your-org/your-repo` (your own GitHub repository)
</Step>

<Step title="Clone your repository">
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Your own repository">
    Replace `your-org/your-repo` with your repository from [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings).
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
    cd your-repo
    ```

    <Tip>
      Install the [GitHub app](/deploy/github) to enable automatic deployments.
    </Tip>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mintlify-hosted repository">
    On the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page, select **Clone as private** or **Clone as public**.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Install the CLI

Run the following command to install the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Preview locally

Navigate to your documentation directory containing your `docs.json` file and run:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, if you do not want to install the CLI globally, you can run a one-time script:

```bash
npx mint dev
```

### Custom ports

Customize the port with the `--port` flag:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If a port is in use, the CLI uses the next available port.

## Skip OpenAPI processing

Skip OpenAPI processing to improve performance:

```bash
mint dev --disable-openapi
```

### Preview as a specific group

Preview as a specific authentication group:

```bash
mint dev --groups admin
```

## Create a new project

Create a new documentation project:

```bash
mint new [directory]
```

This clones the [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter). Without a directory, the CLI prompts you to create a subdirectory or overwrite the current directory.

<Warning>
  Overwriting the current directory deletes existing files.
</Warning>

The CLI prompts for a project name and [theme](/customize/themes).

### Flags

| Flag | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--name` | Set the name of the new project. | Yes |
| `--theme` | Set the [theme](/customize/themes) of the new project. | Yes |
| `--force` | Overwrite the current directory without prompting, even if it contains existing files. | No |

In non-interactive environments (CI/CD, AI agents), provide all required flags (`--name` and `--theme`).

<Tip>
  The CLI detects non-interactive environments and outputs usage instructions if flags are missing.
</Tip>

## Update the CLI

Update the CLI if your local preview is out of sync:

```bash
mint update
```

If `mint update` is unavailable, reinstall the CLI:

 <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm i -g mint@latest
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g mint@latest
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

## Additional commands

### Find broken links

Identify broken internal links:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

Files matching [.mintignore](/organize/mintignore) patterns are ignored. Links to ignored files are reported as broken.

### Find accessibility issues

Test color contrast and missing alt text:

```bash
mint a11y
```

Use flags to check for specific accessibility issues.

```bash
# Check only for missing alt text
mint a11y --skip-contrast

# Check only for color contrast issues
mint a11y --skip-alt-text
```

### Validate documentation build

Validate in strict mode (exits with error on warnings). Use in CI/CD to prevent broken deployments.

```bash
mint validate
```

Use flags to configure the validation command.

- `--groups [groupname]`: Mock user groups for validation (useful when testing group-based access control)
- `--disable-openapi`: Disable OpenAPI file generation during validation

### Check OpenAPI spec

Check your OpenAPI file for errors:

```bash
mint openapi-check <OpenAPI filename or URL>
```

Pass a filename (`./openapi.yaml`) or URL (`https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`).

### Rename files

Rename and update all references:

```bash
mint rename <path/to/old-filename> <path/to/new-filename>
```

### Migrate MDX endpoint pages

Migrate MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages:

```bash
mint migrate-mdx
```

Converts MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages, moves content to the `x-mint` extension, and updates navigation. See [Migrating from MDX](/guides/migrating-from-mdx).

## Formatting

Use IDE extensions for MDX:

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the mint CLI: `npm uninstall -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js.
    3. Reinstall the mint CLI: `npm install -g mint`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    **Solution**: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Afterwards, run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error: permission denied">
    This is due to not having the required permissions to globally install node packages.

    **Solution**: Try running `sudo npm i -g mint`. You will be prompted for your password, which is the one you use to unlock your computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The local preview doesn't look the same as my docs do on the web">
    This is likely due to an outdated version of the CLI.

   **Solution:** Run `mint update` to get the latest changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="mintlify vs. mint package">
    If you have any problems with the CLI package, you should first run `npm ls -g`. This command shows what packages are globally installed on your machine.

    If you don't use npm or don't see it in the -g list, try `which mint` to locate the installation.
    
    If you have a package named `mint` and a package named `mintlify` installed, you should uninstall `mintlify`.
    
    1. Uninstall the old package:
    ```bash
      npm uninstall -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Clear your npm cache:
    ```bash
      npm cache clean --force
    ```
    3. Reinstall the new package:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client version shows 'none' after installation">
    If you run `mint version` and the client version displays as `none`, the CLI may be unable to download the client application due to a corporate firewall or VPN blocking the download.

    **Solution:** Ask your IT administrator to whitelist `releases.mintlify.com` to enable local development with the CLI.
