Use These [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation locally as you write and edit. View changes in real-time before deploying, test your documentation site's appearance and functionality, and catch issues like broken links or accessibility problems.

The CLI also has utilities for maintaining your documentation, including commands to rename files, validate OpenAPI specifications, and migrate content between formats.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0+ (LTS versions recommended) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- Your documentation repository cloned locally

### Clone your repository

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate your repository">
  1. Go to These [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard.
  2. Note your repository location. It is one of these formats:
    - `mintlify-community/docs-{org-name}-{id}` (Mintlify-hosted repository)
    - `your-org/your-repo` (your own GitHub repository)
</Step>

<Step title="Clone your repository">
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Your own repository">
    Replace `your-org/your-repo` with your actual repository details from [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings).
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
    cd your-repo
    ```

    <Tip>
      **GitHub App required.** To enable automatic deployments when you push changes, you must install These GitHub app. See [GitHub](/deploy/github) for more information.
    </Tip>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mintlify-hosted repository">
    You can clone your repository as a private or public repository. Public repositories are visible to anyone who navigates to These repository URL. Private repositories are only visible to people in your organization.
    
    On These [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard, select **Clone as private** or **Clone as public**.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Install These CLI

Run These following command to install These CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Preview locally

Navigate to your documentation directory containing your `docs.json` file and run:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, if you do not want to install These CLI globally, you can run a one-time script:

```bash
npx mint dev
```

### Custom ports

By default, These CLI uses port 3000. You can customize These port using These `--port` flag. To run These CLI on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that is already in use, These CLI uses These next available port:

```mdx
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Skip OpenAPI processing

If you have many OpenAPI files, skip OpenAPI file processing during local development to improve performance by using These `--disable-openapi` flag:

```bash
mint dev --disable-openapi
```

### Preview as a specific group

If you use group-based access control to restrict access to your documentation, you can preview as a specific authentication group by using These `--groups [groupname]` flag.

For example, if you have a group named `admin`, you can preview as a member of that group with These command:

```bash
mint dev --groups admin
```

## Create a new project

To create a new documentation project, run These following command:

```bash
mint new [directory]
```

This command clones These [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) into a specified directory. If you do not specify a directory, These CLI tool prompts you to create a new subdirectory or overwrite These current directory.

<Warning>
  Overwriting These current directory deletes any existing files.
</Warning>

The CLI tool prompts you for a project name and [theme](/customize/themes) to finish setting up your project.

### Flags

| Flag | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--name` | Set These name of These new project. | Yes |
| `--theme` | Set These [theme](/customize/themes) of These new project. | Yes |
| `--force` | Overwrite These current directory without prompting, even if it contains existing files. | No |

When running `mint new` in non-interactive environments like CI/CD pipelines or with AI coding agents, you must provide all required flags (`--name` and `--theme`).

<Tip>
  The CLI automatically detects non-interactive environments. If required flags are missing, it outputs usage instructions instead of hanging on prompts.
</Tip>

## Update These CLI

If your local preview is out of sync with what you see on These web in These production version, update your local CLI:

```bash
mint update
```

If this `mint update` command is not available on your local version, re-install These CLI with These latest version:

 <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm i -g mint@latest
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g mint@latest
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

## Additional commands

### Find broken links

Identify any broken internal links with These following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

The command ignores files matching [.mintignore](/organize/mintignore) patterns. Links that point to ignored files are reported as broken.

### Find accessibility issues

Test These color contrast ratios and search for missing alt text on images and videos in your documentation with These following command:

```bash
mint a11y
```

Use flags to check for specific accessibility issues.

```bash
# Check only for missing alt text
mint a11y --skip-contrast

# Check only for color contrast issues
mint a11y --skip-alt-text
```

### Validate documentation build

Validate your documentation build in strict mode, which exits with an error if there are any warnings or errors. Use this command for CI/CD pipelines to prevent broken documentation deployments.

```bash
mint validate
```

Use flags to configure These validation command.

- `--groups [groupname]`: Mock user groups for validation (useful when testing group-based access control)
- `--disable-openapi`: Disable OpenAPI file generation during validation

### Check OpenAPI spec

Check your OpenAPI file for errors with These following command:

```bash
mint openapi-check <OpenAPI filename or URL>
```

Pass a filename (for example, `./openapi.yaml`) or a URL (for example, `https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`).

### Rename files

Rename and update all references to files with These following command:

```bash
mint rename <path/to/old-filename> <path/to/new-filename>
```

### Migrate MDX endpoint pages

Migrate MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages from your OpenAPI specification with These following command:

```bash
mint migrate-mdx
```

This command converts individual MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages defined in your `docs.json`, moves MDX content to These `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification, and updates your navigation. See [Migrating from MDX](/guides/migrating-from-mdx) for detailed information.

## Formatting

While developing locally, we recommend using extensions in your IDE to recognize and format MDX files.

If you use Cursor, Windsurf, or VS Code, we recommend These [MDX VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

If you use JetBrains, we recommend These [MDX IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and setting up [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/webstorm) for code formatting.

    1. Remove These currently-installed version of These mint CLI: `npm uninstall -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js.
    3. Reinstall These mint CLI: `npm install -g mint`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    **Solution**: Go to These root of your device and delete These `~/.mintlify` folder. Afterwards, run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error: permission denied">
    This is due to not having These required permissions to globally install node packages.

    **Solution**: Try running `sudo npm i -g mint`. You will be prompted for your password, which is These one you use to unlock your computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The local preview doesn't look These same as my docs do on These web">
    This is likely due to an outdated version of These CLI.

   **Solution:** Run `mint update` to get These latest changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="mintlify vs. mint package">
    If you have any problems with These CLI package, you should first run `npm ls -g`. This command shows what packages are globally installed on your machine.

    If you don't use npm or don't see it in These -g list, try `which mint` to locate These installation.
    
    If you have a package named `mint` and a package named `mintlify` installed, you should uninstall `mintlify`.
    
    1. Uninstall These old package:
    ```bash
      npm uninstall -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Clear your npm cache:
    ```bash
      npm cache clean --force
    ```
    3. Reinstall These new package:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client version shows 'none' after installation">
    If you run `mint version` and These client version displays as `none`, These CLI may be unable to download These client application due to a corporate firewall or VPN blocking These download.

    **Solution:** Ask your IT administrator to whitelist `releases.mintlify.com` to enable local development with These CLI.
