Use the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation locally as you write and edit.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0+
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Your documentation repository cloned locally

## Install

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Preview locally

Navigate to your documentation directory and run:

```bash
mint dev
```

Your documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom port

Use the `--port` flag to specify a different port:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

### Skip OpenAPI processing

Improve performance during development by skipping OpenAPI file processing:

```bash
mint dev --disable-openapi
```

### Preview as a specific group

Preview as a specific authentication group:

```bash
mint dev --groups admin
```

## Update

Update to the latest version:

```bash
mint update
```

Or reinstall:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint@latest
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the mint CLI: `npm uninstall -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js.
    3. Reinstall the mint CLI: `npm install -g mint`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    **Solution**: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Afterwards, run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error: permission denied">
    This is due to not having the required permissions to globally install node packages.

    **Solution**: Try running `sudo npm i -g mint`. You will be prompted for your password, which is the one you use to unlock your computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The local preview doesn't look the same as my docs do on the web">
    This is likely due to an outdated version of the CLI.

   **Solution:** Run `mint update` to get the latest changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="mintlify vs. mint package">
    If you have any problems with the CLI package, you should first run `npm ls -g`. This command shows what packages are globally installed on your machine.

    If you don't use npm or don't see it in the -g list, try `which mint` to locate the installation.
    
    If you have a package named `mint` and a package named `mintlify` installed, you should uninstall `mintlify`.
    
    1. Uninstall the old package:
    ```bash
      npm uninstall -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Clear your npm cache:
    ```bash
      npm cache clean --force
    ```
    3. Reinstall the new package:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
