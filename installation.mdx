The CLI lets you preview your documentation locally as you write and edit, viewing changes in real-time before deploying, testing your documentation site's appearance and functionality, and catching issues like broken links or accessibility problems, while also providing utilities for maintaining your documentation including commands to rename files, validate OpenAPI specifications, and migrate content between formats. To get started, install the CLI globally using `npm i -g mint` or `pnpm add -g mint` (requires Node.js v20.17.0 or higher through v24, with LTS versions preferred), then navigate to your documentation directory where your `docs.json` file is located and run `mint dev` to generate a local preview at `http://localhost:3000` (or use `npx mint dev` for a one-time script without global installation). You can customize the port with the `--port` flag (for example, `mint dev --port 3333`), preview as a specific authentication group using `--groups [groupname]` if you use partial authentication, create a new documentation project with `mint new [directory]` which clones the starter kit and prompts you for a project name and theme (with optional flags `--theme`, `--name`, and `--force`), update your CLI with `mint update` or reinstall with `npm i -g mint@latest` if your local preview is out of sync with production, and use additional commands like `mint broken-links` to identify broken internal links, `mint a11y` to test color contrast ratios and find missing alt text, `mint openapi-check <filename or URL>` to check your OpenAPI file for errors, `mint rename <old-filename> <new-filename>` to rename and update all file references, and `mint migrate-mdx` to migrate MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages from your OpenAPI specification. For local development, we recommend using IDE extensions to recognize and format MDX files: the MDX VS Code extension for syntax highlighting and Prettier for code formatting in Cursor, Windsurf, or VS Code, or the MDX IntelliJ IDEA plugin for syntax highlighting and Prettier setup in JetBrains.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the mint CLI: `npm uninstall -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js.
    3. Reinstall the mint CLI: `npm install -g mint`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    **Solution**: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Afterwards, run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error: permission denied">
    This is due to not having the required permissions to globally install node packages.

    **Solution**: Try running `sudo npm i -g mint`. You will be prompted for your password, which is the one you use to unlock your computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The local preview doesn't look the same as my docs do on the web">
    This is likely due to an outdated version of the CLI.

   **Solution:** Run `mint update` to get the latest changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="mintlify vs. mint package">
    If you have any problems with the CLI package, you should first run `npm ls -g`. This command shows what packages are globally installed on your machine.

    If you don't use npm or don't see it in the -g list, try `which mint` to locate the installation.
    
    If you have a package named `mint` and a package named `mintlify` installed, you should uninstall `mintlify`.
    
    1. Uninstall the old package:
    ```bash
      npm uninstall -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Clear your npm cache:
    ```bash
      npm cache clean --force
    ```
    3. Reinstall the new package:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
