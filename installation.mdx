Use the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation locally as you write and edit. View changes in real-time, test your site's appearance and functionality, and catch issues like broken links or accessibility problems before deploying.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0+ (LTS versions recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Your documentation repository cloned locally

## Clone your repository

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate your repository">
  1. Go to the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard.
  2. Note your repository location. It is one of these formats:
    - `mintlify-community/docs-{org-name}-{id}` (Mintlify-hosted repository)
    - `your-org/your-repo` (your own GitHub repository)
</Step>

<Step title="Clone your repository">
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Your own repository">
    Replace `your-org/your-repo` with your actual repository details from [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings).
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
    cd your-repo
    ```

    <Tip>
      **GitHub App required.** To enable automatic deployments when you push changes, you must install the GitHub app. See [GitHub](/deploy/github) for more information.
    </Tip>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mintlify-hosted repository">
    You can clone your repository as a private or public repository. Public repositories are visible to anyone who navigates to the repository URL. Private repositories are only visible to people in your organization.
    
    On the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard, select **Clone as private** or **Clone as public**.
  </Tab>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Install the CLI

Run the following command to install the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Preview locally

Navigate to your documentation directory and run:

```bash
mint dev
```

Your documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Tip>
  If you don't want to install the CLI globally, use `npx mint dev` instead.
</Tip>

### Development flags

Customize your local preview with these flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--port <number>` | Use a custom port (default: 3000). |
| `--disable-openapi` | Skip OpenAPI processing to improve performance. |
| `--groups <groupname>` | Preview as a specific authentication group. |

```bash
# Custom port
mint dev --port 3333

# Skip OpenAPI processing
mint dev --disable-openapi

# Preview as admin group
mint dev --groups admin
```

## Create a new project

Create a new documentation project from the [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter):

```bash
mint new [directory]
```

The CLI prompts you for a project name and [theme](/customize/themes). If you don't specify a directory, you can create a subdirectory or overwrite the current directory.

<Warning>
  Overwriting the current directory deletes existing files.
</Warning>

### Non-interactive mode

For CI/CD pipelines or automated environments, provide all required flags:

```bash
mint new my-docs --name "My Documentation" --theme quill
```

| Flag | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--name` | Project name. | Yes |
| `--theme` | [Theme](/customize/themes) for the project. | Yes |
| `--force` | Overwrite directory without prompting. | No |

## Update the CLI

If your local preview is out of sync with what you see on the web in the production version, update your local CLI:

```bash
mint update
```

If this `mint update` command is not available on your local version, re-install the CLI with the latest version:

 <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm i -g mint@latest
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g mint@latest
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

## Maintenance commands

### Broken links

Find broken internal links in your documentation:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

<Note>
  Files matching [.mintignore](/organize/mintignore) patterns are ignored. Links to ignored files are reported as broken.
</Note>

### Accessibility

Check color contrast ratios and missing alt text:

```bash
mint a11y

# Check only alt text
mint a11y --skip-contrast

# Check only color contrast
mint a11y --skip-alt-text
```

### Validate build

Validate your documentation in strict mode for CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
mint validate

# With authentication groups
mint validate --groups admin

# Skip OpenAPI processing
mint validate --disable-openapi
```

### OpenAPI validation

Check your OpenAPI specification for errors:

```bash
mint openapi-check ./openapi.yaml
mint openapi-check https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

### Rename files

Rename files and update all references automatically:

```bash
mint rename path/to/old-filename path/to/new-filename
```

### Migrate MDX endpoints

Convert MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated OpenAPI pages:

```bash
mint migrate-mdx
```

This command moves MDX content to the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI spec and updates navigation. See [Migrating from MDX](/guides/migrating-from-mdx) for details.

## Formatting

While developing locally, we recommend using extensions in your IDE to recognize and format MDX files.

If you use Cursor, Windsurf, or VS Code, we recommend the [MDX VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

If you use JetBrains, we recommend the [MDX IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and setting up [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/webstorm) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the mint CLI: `npm uninstall -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js.
    3. Reinstall the mint CLI: `npm install -g mint`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    **Solution**: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Afterwards, run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error: permission denied">
    This is due to not having the required permissions to globally install node packages.

    **Solution**: Try running `sudo npm i -g mint`. You will be prompted for your password, which is the one you use to unlock your computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The local preview doesn't look the same as my docs do on the web">
    This is likely due to an outdated version of the CLI.

   **Solution:** Run `mint update` to get the latest changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="mintlify vs. mint package">
    If you have any problems with the CLI package, you should first run `npm ls -g`. This command shows what packages are globally installed on your machine.

    If you don't use npm or don't see it in the -g list, try `which mint` to locate the installation.
    
    If you have a package named `mint` and a package named `mintlify` installed, you should uninstall `mintlify`.
    
    1. Uninstall the old package:
    ```bash
      npm uninstall -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Clear your npm cache:
    ```bash
      npm cache clean --force
    ```
    3. Reinstall the new package:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client version shows 'none' after installation">
    If you run `mint version` and the client version displays as `none`, the CLI may be unable to download the client application due to a corporate firewall or VPN blocking the download.

    **Solution:** Ask your IT administrator to whitelist `releases.mintlify.com` to enable local development with the CLI.
