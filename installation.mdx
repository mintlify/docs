Use the CLI to preview your documentation locally as you write and edit. View changes in real-time before deploying, test your documentation site's appearance and functionality, and catch issues like broken links or accessibility problems.

The CLI also has utilities for maintaining your documentation, including commands to rename files, validate OpenAPI specifications, and migrate content between formats.

## Install the CLI

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v19 or higher.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Run the following command to install the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint):

  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm i -g mint
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g mint
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview locally">
    Navigate to your docs directory (where your `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    mint dev
    ```

    A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Alternatively, if you do not want to install the CLI globally, you can run a one-time script:

```bash
npx mint dev
```

## Updates

If your local preview is out of sync with what you see on the web in the production version, update your local CLI:

```bash
mint update
```

If this `mint update` command is not available on your local version, re-install the CLI with the latest version:

 <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm i -g mint@latest
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g mint@latest
    ```
  </CodeGroup>

## Custom ports

By default, the CLI uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag. To run the CLI on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that is already in use, it will use the next available port:

```mdx
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Preview as a specific group

If you use partial authentication to restrict access to your documentation, you can preview as a specific authentication group by using the `--groups [groupname]` flag.

For example, if you have a group named `admin`, you can preview as a member of that group with the command:

```bash
mint dev --groups admin
```

## Additional commands

### Find broken links

Identify any broken internal links with the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

### Find accessibility issues

Test the color contrast ratios and search for missing alt text on images and videos in your documentation with the following command:

```bash
mint a11y
```

### Check OpenAPI spec

Check your OpenAPI file for errors with the following command:

```bash
mint openapi-check <OpenAPI filename or URL>
```

Pass a filename (for example, `./openapi.yaml`) or a URL (for example, `https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`).

### Rename files

Rename and update all references to files with the following command:

```bash
mint rename <path/to/old-filename> <path/to/new-filename>
```

### Migrate MDX endpoint pages

Migrate MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages from your OpenAPI specification with the following command:

```bash
mint migrate-mdx
```

This command converts individual MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages defined in your `docs.json`, moves MDX content to the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification, and updates your navigation. See [Migrating from MDX](/guides/migrating-from-mdx) for detailed information.

## Formatting

While developing locally, we recommend using extensions in your IDE to recognize and format `MDX` files.

If you use Cursor, Windsurf, or VS Code, we recommend the [MDX VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

If you use JetBrains, we recommend the [MDX IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and setting up [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/webstorm) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the mint CLI: `npm uninstall -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js.
    3. Reinstall the mint CLI: `npm install -g mint`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    **Solution**: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Afterwards, run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error: permission denied">
    This is due to not having the required permissions to globally install node packages.

    **Solution**: Try running `sudo npm i -g mint`. You will be prompted for your password, which is the one you use to unlock your computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The local preview doesn't look the same as my docs do on the web">
    This is likely due to an outdated version of the CLI.

   **Solution:** Run `mint update` to get the latest changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="mintlify vs. mint package">
    If you have any problems with the CLI package, you should first run `npm ls -g`. This command shows what packages are globally installed on your machine.

    If you don't use npm or don't see it in the -g list, try `which mint` to locate the installation.
    
    If you have a package named `mint` and a package named `mintlify` installed, you should uninstall `mintlify`.
    
    1. Uninstall the old package:
    ```bash
      npm uninstall -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Clear your npm cache:
    ```bash
      npm cache clean --force
    ```
    3. Reinstall the new package:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
