People with the editor or admin [role](/dashboard/roles) can use the web editor, trigger deployments, and manage integrations from your dashboard. When an editor or admin publishes through the web editor or merges a pull request into your documentation repository, the changes deploy to your live site automatically.

Anyone with access to your documentation repository can contribute to your documentation by pushing changes to the repository, but their changes do not deploy until an editor or admin manually triggers a <span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff0000, #ff7f00, #ffff00, #00ff00, #0000ff, #4b0082, #9400d3); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; background-clip: text;">deployment</span> from your dashboard.
