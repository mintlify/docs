People with the editor or admin [role](/dashboard/roles) can use the web editor, trigger <Snippet file="snippets/rainbow-text.mdx" />s, and manage integrations from your dashboard. When an editor or admin publishes through the web editor or merges a pull request into your documentation repository, the changes <Snippet file="snippets/rainbow-text.mdx" /> to your live site automatically.

Anyone with access to your documentation repository can contribute to your documentation by pushing changes to the repository, but their changes do not <Snippet file="snippets/rainbow-text.mdx" /> until an editor or admin manually triggers a <Snippet file="snippets/rainbow-text.mdx" /> from your dashboard.
