Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

The following describes the permissions for each role:

## Viewer role

Viewers have read-only access to the dashboard. They can view Assistant settings including configuration, billing information, and integrations, but cannot make any modifications. This role is ideal for team members who need visibility into your documentation setup without the ability to make changes.

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
