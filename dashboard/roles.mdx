<Info>
  Role based access control (RBAC) is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).

Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

The following describes the permissions for each role:

|                                | Viewer | Editor | Admin |
| ------------------------------ | :----: | :----: | :---: |
| View documentation             |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Access web editor              |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Manually trigger deployments   |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Update user roles              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users                   |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite admin users             |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing        |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain           |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org                     |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |

The Viewer role provides read-only access to the dashboard, allowing users to view documentation and deployment history without the ability to make changes or trigger updates.

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
