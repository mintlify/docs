Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

The following describes the permissions for each role:

| Update Assistant configuration       |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Manage Assistant integrations        |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |

| Manage & update billing              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain                 |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source                    |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org                           |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |

**Viewer** role provides read-only access to the dashboard. Viewers can view all settings and analytics but cannot make any modifications.

**Editor** role can modify documentation settings, Assistant configuration, and integrations, but cannot manage users, billing, or organization settings.

**Admin** role has full access to all dashboard features including user management, billing, and organization settings.

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
