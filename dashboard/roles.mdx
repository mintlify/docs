<Info>
  Role based access control (RBAC) is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).
</Info>

Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

## Access levels

### Viewer
Viewers have read-only access to the dashboard. They can view documentation, analytics, and team members, but cannot make any changes or access the Editor.

### Editor
Editors can make changes to documentation content using the Editor and access most dashboard features, but cannot manage team settings or billing.

### Admin
Admins have full access to all dashboard features, including team management, billing, and organization settings.

## Permissions comparison

The following table describes the permissions for each role:

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
