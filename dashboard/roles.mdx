<Info>
  Role based access control (RBAC) is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).
</Info>

Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

## Viewer

The Viewer role has read-only access to most dashboard features, including:

- View analytics and usage metrics
- Venabled features and add-ons
- View recent deployments
- View dashboard configurations

Viewers cannot create PI_keys, make edits in the editor, toggle add-ons, or modify any settings.

## Editor vs Admin

The following describes actions that differ between Editor and Admin roles:

|                         | Viewer | Editor | Admin |

| View analytics          |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| View enabled features   |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| View recent deploys     |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Create API keys         |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Make edits in editor    |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Toggle add-ons (feedback, thumbs up/down) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modify non-sensitive fields (deployment name) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update user roles       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users            |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite admin users      |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
