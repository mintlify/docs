<Info>
  Role based access control (RBAC) is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).
</Info>

Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

<Note>
  The Viewer role is currently behind a feature flag and not available to all organizations.
</Note>

The following describes actions that are limited by role:

|                         | Viewer | Editor | Admin |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :----: | :---: |
| Update user roles       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users            |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite Admins           |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite Editors          |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Invite Viewers          |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |

Other actions on the dashboard are available to both roles.

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
