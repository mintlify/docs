## Add members to your organization

By default, the person who creates your Mintlify organization has admin access. Add additional editors in the [Members](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members) page of your dashboard.

You can have as many members as you need in your organization. Seats can incur additional costs. See the [pricing page](https://mintlify.com/pricing) for more details.
