<Info>
  Role based access control (RBAC) is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).
</Info>

Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

## Permissions

The following describes actions that are limited by role:

|                         | Viewer | Editor | Admin |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :----: | :---: |
| View documentation      |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Edit documentation      |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Update user roles       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users            |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite admin users      |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |

### Viewer role

The Viewer role provides read-only access to the dashboard. Users with this role can view documentation and analytics but cannot make any changes to content or settings.

### Editor role

The Editor role allows users to view and edit documentation content. Editors can make changes to documentation but cannot manage users, billing, or organization settings.

### Admin role

The Admin role has full access to all dashboard features, including user management, billing, and organization settings.

## Privilege escalation rules

When RBAC is enabled, users cannot invite others with roles they don't have themselves. For example:

- A Viewer cannot invite any users
- An Editor cannot invite Admins
- An Admin can invite users with any role

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin access to users who need it.
