<Info>
  Role based access control (RBAC) is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).
</Info>

Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

## Permissions by role

The following table describes the permissions for each role:

|                         | Viewer | Editor | Admin |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :----: | :---: |
| View documentation      |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| View analytics          |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Edit content            |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Publish changes         |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Update user roles       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users            |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite users            |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |

## Role descriptions

**Viewer**: Read-only access to view documentation and analytics. Cannot make any changes to content or settings.

**Editor**: Can view and edit documentation content, publish changes, and invite other users. Cannot modify organization settings or manage billing.

**Admin**: Full access to all dashboard features, including organization settings, billing, and user management.

## Privilege escalation rules

When RBAC is enabled, users cannot invite others with roles they don't have themselves. For example:

- A Viewer cannot invite any users
- An Editor can invite Viewers and Editors, but not Admins
- An Admin can invite users with any role

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
