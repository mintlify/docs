<Info>
  Role based access control (RBAC) is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).
</Info>

Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Viewer, Editor, and Admin.

## Access levels

- **Viewer**: Read-only access to documentation. Viewers can view all content but cannot make changes or access administrative functions.
- **Editor**: Can create, edit, and publish documentation content.
- **Admin**: Full access to all dashboard features, including user management, billing, and organization settings.

## Permissions

The following table describes the permissions for each role:

|                         | Viewer | Editor | Admin |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :----: | :---: |
| View documentation      |   ✅   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Edit content            |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Update user roles       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users            |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite users            |   ❌   |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source       |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org              |   ❌   |   ❌   |  ✅   |

## Privilege escalation rules

When RBAC is enabled, users cannot invite others with roles they don't have themselves. For example:

- A Viewer cannot invite any users
- An Editor can invite Viewers and Editors, but not Admins
- An Admin can invite users with any role

This prevents privilege escalation and ensures proper access control within your organization.

You can invite as many users as you need, but we recommend limiting admin access to users who require it for organizational management.
