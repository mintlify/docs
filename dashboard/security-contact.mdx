Use the security contact feature to designate an email address for receiving security-related communications about your organization. This ensures that critical security notifications reach the appropriate team members.

## Set a security contact

Go to the [Security contact](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/security-contact) page of your dashboard to configure your security contact email.

1. Enter a valid email address in the security contact field.
1. Click **Save** to update your security contact.

The email address will be used for security-related communications about your organization and platform.

## Update a security contact

You can update your security contact email at any time:

1. Navigate to the [Security contact](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/security-contact) page.
1. Enter the new email address.
1. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

## Remove a security contact

To remove your security contact:

1. Navigate to the [Security contact](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/security-contact) page.
1. Click **Remove** to delete the current security contact email.

Once removed, you will no longer receive security-related communications at that address until you set a new security contact.
