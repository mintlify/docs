<Info>
  SSO is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=sso).
</Info>

Use single sign-on to your dashboard via SAML and OIDC. If you use Okta, Google Workspace, or Microsoft Entra, we have provider-specific documentation for setting up SSO. If you use another provider, please [contact us](mailto:support@mintlify.com).

## Managing SSO settings

Once SSO is configured, you can manage your SSO settings through the dashboard at `/organization/sso`. This self-serve interface allows you to:

- View your current SSO configuration status
- Switch between SSO providers (Okta and Microsoft Entra)
- Enable or disable JIT (Just-In-Time) provisioning
- Remove your SSO configuration

### JIT provisioning

JIT (Just-In-Time) provisioning automatically creates user accounts when someone logs in through your identity provider. When you enable JIT provisioning:

- Users who are not already invited to Mintlify will be automatically created when they log in through your IdP
- **SSO will be enforced for all logins** to your organization

You can toggle JIT provisioning on or off at any time from the SSO settings page.

### Switching SSO providers

To switch between SSO providers:

1. Navigate to `/organization/sso` in your dashboard
2. Click the settings icon on your SSO configuration card
3. Select a different provider from the dropdown (Okta or Microsoft Entra)
4. Enter the metadata URL for your new provider
5. Click **Save changes**

The system will automatically fetch the required connection URLs (Single sign-on URL and Audience URI) for the new provider.

### Disabling SSO

To remove your SSO configuration:

1. Navigate to `/organization/sso` in your dashboard
2. Click the settings icon on your SSO configuration card
3. Select **No SSO** from the provider dropdown
4. Click **Save changes**

This will disable SSO for your organization and remove the JIT provisioning settings.
