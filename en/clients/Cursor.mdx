## Special Instructions (Using claude-3.5 in Cursor)
Since Cursor automatically requests Claude's API based on request names, we have added a new name **anthropic-3-5-sonnet-20240620** to map to claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. This bypasses Cursor's automatic request, allowing us to use the Claude API through our service.  
- The specific method is: Add a model named **anthropic-3-5-sonnet-20240620** to the model list. Select and enable this model.
