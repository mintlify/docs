Then you can start using it.  
## Special Cases (Using Non-OpenAI Models)  
If you want to use non-OpenAI models in the Next Web client, follow these steps.  
First, ensure you have upgraded to the latest version (v2.13.0). In this version, a method for custom models has been added:  
1. **Enter Custom Model Name**:
   - Since the Next Web client automatically determines the model provider based on the input model name, and the key provided by this site is only applicable to the OpenAI interface.
   - Therefore, when entering a custom model name, the format should be: “+‘desired model name’@OpenAI”.
   - For example, to use the gemini-pro model, enter the custom model name as: “+gemini-pro@OpenAI”.
   - This way, you can manually direct the model provider to OpenAI.  
2. **Confirm Selection**:
   - In the model selection interface, confirm that the manually added model (OpenAI) appears below.
