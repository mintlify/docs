{/* The API playground is an interactive environment to make requests and preview an API endpoint. */}
The API Playground provides a sandbox environment for real-time request testing and intuitive response data visualization.

<Info>
  For code security, we recommend:
  1. Managing sensitive information (such as API Keys) through environment variables. For Python calls, use `os.getenv("AIHUBMIX_API_KEY")`.
  2. Avoiding printing sensitive information in logs/outputs.
  3. Preventing key leakage by adding .env to .gitignore to keep secrets out of the code repository.
