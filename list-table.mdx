## Lists

Lists follow the official [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1).

### Ordered list

To create an ordered list, add numbers followed by a period before list items.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```mdx
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Unordered list

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) before list items.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

```mdx
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested list

Indent list items to nest them.

- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item

```mdx
- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item
```

## Tables

Tables follow the official [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.
