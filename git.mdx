## Basic Git commands

Once Git is installed, here are some essential commands to get you started:

### Initialize a repository
```bash
git init
```

### Clone a repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### Check repository status
```bash
git status
```

### Add files to staging
```bash
git add filename.mdx
# or add all files
git add .
```

### Commit changes
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Push changes to remote repository
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command 'git' not found">
    This means Git is not installed or not in your system's PATH.

    **Solution**: 
    1. Reinstall Git following the steps above
    2. Restart your terminal or command prompt
    3. On Windows, make sure Git was added to your PATH during installation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey)">
    This error occurs when trying to push to a remote repository without proper authentication.

    **Solution**: 
    1. Set up SSH keys for your Git hosting service
    2. Or use HTTPS with your username and password/token
    3. Check your repository's remote URL with `git remote -v`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Git commands are slow on Windows">
    This can happen due to Windows Defender or antivirus software scanning.

    **Solution**: 
    1. Add your Git repositories folder to Windows Defender exclusions
    2. Consider using Git Bash instead of Command Prompt
    3. Enable Git's built-in file system cache: `git config --global core.preloadindex true`
  </Accordion>
