Branches in Git allow you to work on different features or fixes without affecting your main codebase. This guide covers intermediate branching workflows and best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Git commits and repositories
- Access to a Git repository

## Understanding branches

A branch is a pointer to a specific commit in your repository. The default branch is typically called `main` or `master`. When you create a branch, you're creating a new pointer that can move independently.

```bash
# View all branches
git branch

# View all branches including remote
git branch -a
```

## Creating branches

### Create a new branch

```bash
# Create a branch
git branch feature-name

# Create and switch to the branch
git checkout -b feature-name
```

### Using the modern switch command

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git switch -c feature-name

# Switch to an existing branch
git switch main
```

## Branch naming conventions

Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the branch:

**Good examples:**
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `fix/login-button-bug`
- `docs/api-reference`
- `refactor/database-queries`

**Avoid:**
- `test`
- `my-branch`
- `temp`
- `branch1`

## Working with branches

### Switch between branches

```bash
# Using checkout
git checkout branch-name

# Using switch (Git 2.23+)
git switch branch-name
```

<Warning>
Make sure to commit or stash your changes before switching branches to avoid losing work.
</Warning>

### Track remote branches

```bash
# Push a branch and set up tracking
git push -u origin branch-name

# After setting up tracking, simply use
git push
```

## Merging branches

### Fast-forward merge

When the target branch hasn't diverged, Git performs a fast-forward merge:

```bash
# Switch to the target branch
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature-name
```

### Three-way merge

When both branches have new commits, Git creates a merge commit:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-name
```

### Using pull requests

For team workflows, use pull requests to merge branches:

1. Push your branch to the remote repository
2. Open a pull request on GitHub, GitLab, or your platform
3. Request reviews from team members
4. Merge after approval

## Resolving merge conflicts

When Git can't automatically merge changes, you'll need to resolve conflicts manually:

```bash
# Attempt to merge
git merge feature-name

# Git will indicate which files have conflicts
# Edit the conflicted files to resolve
# Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>

# After resolving, stage the files
git add resolved-file.txt

# Complete the merge
git commit
```

## Deleting branches

### Delete a local branch

```bash
# Delete a merged branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Force delete an unmerged branch
git branch -D branch-name
```

### Delete a remote branch

```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep branches focused">
    Each branch should address one feature, bug, or task. This makes code review easier and reduces merge conflicts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update your branch regularly">
    Regularly merge or rebase your branch with the main branch to minimize conflicts:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout feature-name
    git merge main
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean up merged branches">
    Delete branches after they've been merged to keep your repository organized:
    
    ```bash
    git branch --merged | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -d
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive commit messages">
    Write clear commit messages that explain what changed and why. This helps when reviewing branch history.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common branch workflows

### Feature branch workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push the branch to remote
4. Open a pull request
5. Merge after review
6. Delete the branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
# Create pull request, get review, merge
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

### Hotfix workflow

For urgent fixes to production:

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make the fix and commit
3. Merge directly to `main` (after testing)
4. Tag the release if needed

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
# Make fix
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical bug"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
git push
git branch -d hotfix/critical-bug
```
