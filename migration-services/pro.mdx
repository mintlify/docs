Your Pro plan includes migration services to transfer your documentation to Mintlify. This guide covers the migration process, delivery timelines, and our quality assurance approach.

## What to expect for your migration

A migration is a point-in-time transfer of your documentation that requires a code freeze. We migrate your documentation, branding (logos, colors, and fonts), and navigation structure.

Your migration includes a staging link to review progress and a 3-day feedback window after delivery to address any issues with content, assets, or branding.

<Info>
Migration services **do not** include:
- Dynamic syncing of your documentation
- Design or information architecture consultation
- Custom component development (landing pages, custom integrations, etc.)
- Redirects setup
- API playground configuration
- Analytics setup
</Info>

## Migration process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit the migration form">
    Submit the [migration form](https://mintlify.typeform.com/pro-migrations).
    
    Provide your documentation source, brand assets (logos, color codes, fonts), OpenAPI specs, go-live date, and preferred delivery method (GitHub PR or zip file).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive scoping and timeline (1-2 business days)">
    We review your submission and provide an estimated delivery timeline within 24-48 hours. We'll flag any custom components or areas of your migration that need discussion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review progress during the migration">
    We start the migration and share a staging link so you can monitor progress in real-time.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive final delivery">
    We deliver your migration via GitHub PR or zip file based on your preference.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Feedback window (three business days)">
    Submit any feedback on content, assets, or branding. We address all in-scope issues within the same timeframe.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go-live support">
    We provide documentation and guidance for connecting your repository, setting up redirects, and configuring your custom domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quality assurance

We work with vetted third-party vendors and conduct an internal quality audit before delivery. Here's what we check for:

<Card title="Content completeness" icon="file-check">
  - All documentation from your source has been migrated.
  - Content is properly formatted with Mintlify components.
  - Navigation structure matches your specifications.
</Card>

<Card title="Visual elements" icon="palette">
  - Images and videos display correctly.
  - Custom fonts are applied throughout.
  - Light and dark mode logos are used appropriately.
  - Color schemes meet contrast requirements in both modes.
</Card>

<Card title="Functionality" icon="rocket">
  - All links work correctly (no broken links).
  - Table of contents renders properly.
  - React components function as expected.
  - No performance issues.
</Card>

## After your migration

Once we deliver your migration, you'll need to complete the following steps to launch your documentation:

1. [Connect your GitHub repository and get setup](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/quickstart#install-the-github-app).
2. [Set up redirects if required](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/create/redirects).
3. [Configure your custom domain](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/customize/custom-domain).
4. **Test before going live** - Before switching over from your old documentation:
   - Review all pages on your staging link.
   - Test navigation and search functionality.
   - Verify all images and videos load correctly.
   - Check that code blocks render properly.
   - Test on mobile and desktop.
5. **Launch!** Your documentation is ready to go live!

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does a migration take?">
    We typically deliver migrations within 10 business days, depending on complexity. You'll receive a specific timeline within 24-48 hours of submitting your migration form.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I request changes after delivery?">
    Yes. You have a 3-day feedback window after delivery to request changes to content, assets, or branding. We address all in-scope feedback within the same timeframe.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What do I need to do after the migration is complete?">
    The migration transfers your content, but you'll need to:
    - Connect your documentation repository to your Mintlify dashboard.
    - Set up redirects from your old documentation URLs.
    - Configure your custom domain.
    
    We provide step-by-step documentation and support for each of these steps.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I customize the navigation structure?">
    Yes. You can provide a custom information architecture in the migration form, and we'll implement it. However, custom component development (like custom landing pages) is not included in the migration service.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if my documentation changes during the migration?">
    Since migrations require a code freeze, any changes made to your source documentation after submission won't be included. We recommend completing all updates before starting the migration.
