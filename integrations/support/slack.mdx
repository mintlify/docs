## About the Slack integration

The Slack integration connects Mintlify's Writer Agent with your Slack workspace, providing real-time notifications when documentation updates are completed. The bot can send direct messages and post to channels, keeping your team informed about documentation changes.

### Key features

## Setting up the Slack integration

### Prerequisites

- Slack workspace admin permissions
- Access to your Slack app configuration

### Required OAuth scopes

Configure your Slack app with the following OAuth scopes for full functionality:

#### Bot token scopes

3. **Set up event subscriptions** in your app's Event Subscriptions section
4. **Install the app** to your workspace
5. **Configure the integration** in your Mintlify dashboard

## Using the Slack integration

### Notification types

- **Documentation updates completed**: When Writer Agent finishes updating your docs
- **Pull request creation**: Links to newly created pull requests with documentation changes
- **Status updates**: Real-time updates on Writer Agent processing status

### Message formatting

The bot uses standard Slack formatting:

- **Bold text** using single asterisks (`*bold*`)
- **Links** formatted as `<url|display text>`
- **User mentions** as `<@USER_ID>`
- **Channel references** as `<#CHANNEL_ID>`

### Dashboard integration

The Mintlify dashboard displays:

- Real-time Slack bot status
- Writer Agent completion notifications
- Formatted display for pull request links
- Message history and delivery status

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot not receiving messages">
    Ensure the `im:history` scope is enabled - this is critical for receiving DM events. Check that event subscriptions are properly configured for `message.im`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing channel notifications">
    Verify that the bot has been added to the target channel and has the appropriate `channels:history` or `groups:history` scope depending on channel type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Formatting issues">
    The bot automatically handles Slack message formatting. If links or mentions aren't working, check that the message content follows Slack's formatting standards.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Support

If you encounter issues with the Slack integration:

1. Verify all required OAuth scopes are enabled
2. Check that event subscriptions are properly configured
3. Ensure the bot is installed and has necessary permissions

## Security considerations

- The bot only processes messages and events it's explicitly subscribed to
- Bot messages are automatically filtered to prevent loops
- All communications use Slack's secure API endpoints
- No sensitive documentation content is stored in Slack messages
