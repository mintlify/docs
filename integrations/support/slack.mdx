## About the Slack integration

The Slack bot integration connects Mintlify's Writer Agent with your Slack workspace, providing real-time notifications when documentation updates are completed. The bot can send direct messages and post to channels, keeping your team informed about documentation changes.

### Key features

- **Direct message handling**: Bot responds to direct messages from users
- **Automated notifications**: Receive notifications when Writer Agent completes documentation tasks
- **Pull request notifications**: Get formatted notifications with links to completed pull requests
- **Multi-channel support**: Works in public channels, private channels, and group DMs

## Setting up the Slack integration

### Prerequisites

- Active Mintlify Writer Agent subscription
- Slack workspace admin permissions
- Access to your Slack app configuration

### Required OAuth scopes

Configure your Slack app with the following OAuth scopes for full functionality:

#### Bot token scopes
- `im:read` - Read DM channel information
- `im:write` - Send DM responses  
- `im:history` - **Critical:** Receive DM message events
- `channels:history` - Receive channel message events
- `groups:history` - Receive private channel events
- `mpim:history` - Receive group DM events
- `app_mentions:read` - Receive mentions of the bot
- `chat:write` - Send messages to channels and DMs

### Event subscriptions

Configure these bot event subscriptions in your Slack app settings:

- `message.im` - Direct message events
- `message.channels` - Public channel messages
- `message.groups` - Private channel messages  
- `message.mpim` - Group DM messages
- `app_mention` - When the bot is mentioned

### Installation steps

1. **Create a Slack app** in your workspace or use an existing one
2. **Configure OAuth scopes** as listed above in your app's OAuth & Permissions section
3. **Set up event subscriptions** in your app's Event Subscriptions section
4. **Install the app** to your workspace
5. **Copy the bot token** from the OAuth & Permissions section
6. **Configure the integration** in your Mintlify dashboard

## Using the Slack bot

### Direct messages

Users can send direct messages to the bot to:
- Check the status of documentation updates
- Receive personalized notifications about their requests
- Get help with Writer Agent features

### Channel notifications

The bot automatically posts to configured channels when:
- Documentation updates are completed
- Pull requests are created or merged
- Writer Agent tasks finish processing

### Message formatting

The bot properly handles Slack's message formatting:
- **Bold text** using single asterisks (`*bold*`)
- Links formatted as `<url|display text>`
- User mentions as `<@USER_ID>`
- Channel references as `<#CHANNEL_ID>`

## Dashboard integration

The Mintlify dashboard displays real-time Slack bot status and activity:

- **Bot status indicator**: Shows whether the bot is connected and active
- **Notification history**: View recent notifications sent by the bot
- **Message formatting preview**: See how notifications will appear in Slack
- **Channel configuration**: Manage which channels receive notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding to messages

1. Verify all required OAuth scopes are configured
2. Check that event subscriptions are properly set up
3. Ensure the bot is installed in your workspace
4. Confirm the bot token is correctly configured in your dashboard

### Missing notifications

1. Check channel permissions - the bot needs to be invited to private channels
2. Verify event subscriptions include the appropriate message types
3. Review your notification settings in the Mintlify dashboard
4. Ensure the Writer Agent is properly configured and active

### Formatting issues

The bot uses Slack's standard message formatting. If messages appear incorrectly:
- Check that your Slack client supports rich text formatting
- Verify links are properly formatted as `<url|text>`
- Ensure user and channel mentions use the correct ID format

## Best practices

### Channel management
- Create dedicated channels for documentation notifications
- Use thread replies to keep channels organized
- Set up different notification channels for different projects or teams

### User experience
- Train team members on how to interact with the bot
- Set clear expectations about response times
- Use the bot's status messages to communicate maintenance or updates

### Security
- Regularly review and rotate bot tokens
- Monitor bot activity through Slack's audit logs
- Restrict bot permissions to only necessary scopes

## API integration

For advanced users, the Slack bot integrates with Mintlify's API to provide programmatic access to notification settings and bot status. See the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for detailed information about available endpoints.
