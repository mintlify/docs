## Setting up your Slack webhook

1. Go to your Slack workspace and navigate to **Apps**
2. Search for and install the **Incoming Webhooks** app
3. Click **Add to Slack** and select the channel where you want to receive notifications
4. Copy the webhook URL provided by Slack
5. Add the webhook URL to your `docs.json` file as shown above

## What gets sent to Slack

When configured, your documentation will send notifications to your specified Slack channel for:

- Page views and user engagement
- Feedback submissions (thumbs up/down)
- Search queries and results
- Assistant interactions

This helps you stay informed about how users are interacting with your documentation.
