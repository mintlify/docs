```json Integration options in docs.json
"integrations": {
      "slack": {
            "workspaceId": "WORKSPACE_ID",
            "channelId": "CHANNEL_ID"
      }
}
```

```json Example
"integrations": {
      "slack": {
            "workspaceId": "T1234567890",
            "channelId": "C1234567890"
      }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

To set up Slack integration:

1. **Get your Workspace ID**: Find your Slack workspace ID in your Slack URL (e.g., `https://your-workspace.slack.com` where `your-workspace` is the workspace ID)
2. **Get your Channel ID**: Right-click on the channel name in Slack and select "Copy link" - the channel ID is the last part of the URL after the last `/`
3. **Add the configuration** to your `docs.json` file as shown above

The Slack integration will add a widget that allows users to connect with your team directly through Slack.
