## About the Slack integration

The Slack integration connects your Writer Agent system with Slack, enabling:

- **Direct message handling** - Bot responds to direct messages from users
- **Automated notifications** - Writer Agent completion notifications sent to Slack
- **Real-time status updates** - Display of Writer Agent status in your dashboard
- **Formatted messaging** - Proper rendering of Slack-formatted content including links, mentions, and channels

## Setting up the Slack integration

### Prerequisites

- Active Slack workspace with admin permissions
- Writer Agent system configured
- Access to Slack app configuration

### OAuth scopes

Configure your Slack app with the following OAuth scopes for full functionality:

#### Bot token scopes
- `im:read` - Read DM channel information
- `im:write` - Send DM responses  
- `im:history` - **Critical:** Receive DM message events
- `channels:history` - Receive channel message events
- `groups:history` - Receive private channel events
- `mpim:history` - Receive group DM events

### Event subscriptions

Configure these bot event subscriptions in your Slack app settings:

- `message.im` - Direct message events
- `message.channels` - Public channel messages
- `message.groups` - Private channel messages
- `message.mpim` - Group DM messages
- `app_mention` - When the bot is mentioned

### Installation steps

1. **Create a Slack app** in your workspace or use an existing one
2. **Configure OAuth scopes** as listed above in your app's OAuth & Permissions section
3. **Set up event subscriptions** in your app's Event Subscriptions section
4. **Install the app** to your workspace to generate the bot token
5. **Configure your Writer Agent** system with the Slack app credentials

## Using the Slack integration

### Direct messaging

Users can send direct messages to the Slack bot, which will:

- Process the message through the Writer Agent system
- Respond with relevant information or actions
- Filter out bot messages to prevent loops
- Handle type-safe message processing

### Notifications

The integration automatically sends notifications for:

- Writer Agent task completions
- Pull request updates and links
- System status changes
- Error notifications and alerts

### Message formatting

The integration properly handles Slack's message formatting:

- **Bold text** using single asterisks (`*bold*`)
- **Links** formatted as `<url|display text>`
- **User mentions** as `<@USER_ID>`
- **Channel references** as `<#CHANNEL_ID>`

### Dashboard integration

The Slack integration displays in your dashboard:

- Real-time bot status
- Writer Agent completion notifications
- Formatted pull request links
- Message history and analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding to DMs

Ensure you have configured the `im:history` scope - this is critical for receiving DM message events.

### Missing notifications

Verify that:
- Event subscriptions are properly configured
- The bot is installed in your workspace
- OAuth scopes include all required permissions

### Formatting issues

Check that your Slack app has the correct permissions to read and write messages in the channels where formatting issues occur.

## Security considerations

- Bot tokens should be stored securely and rotated regularly
- Limit bot permissions to only required scopes
- Monitor bot activity through Slack's audit logs
- Review message handling to ensure sensitive information is protected
