Add [Osano](https://www.osano.com/) cookie consent to your docs with a [custom JavaScript file](/customize/custom-scripts#custom-javascript) in your repository.

## Setup

Create an `osano.js` file in your docs repository with the following content:

<CodeGroup>

```js Format
var script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "OSANO_SCRIPT_URL";
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

```js Example
var script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = "https://cmp.osano.com/your-tenant-id/your-site-id/osano.js";
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `OSANO_SCRIPT_URL` with your Osano script URL. Your script URL is the `src` value in the code snippet that Osano generates. Your script URL always starts with `https://cmp.osano.com/` and ends with `/osano.js`.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion
  title="Pages not loading with Strict compliance mode"
>
  If your documentation pages aren't loading properly when using Osano's **Strict** compliance mode, you'll need to add Mintlify's domain to your allowlist to allow images and other assets to load.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Managed Rules">
      In your Osano dashboard, go to **Scripts** → **Managed Rules**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add Mintlify domain">
      Add `.mintlify.app/` as a managed rule.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/integrations/osano-managed-rule.png" alt="Osano managed rule" />
      </Frame>

      <Info>
      This ensures that all Mintlify-served assets (including images, stylesheets, and other documentation resources) are treated as essential and load even when Osano blocks uncategorized third-party content.
