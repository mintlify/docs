Add the following to your `docs.json` file to add the [Osano](https://www.osano.com/) cookie consent manager.

<CodeGroup>

```json Integration options in docs.json
"integrations": {
    "osano": "SOURCE"
}
```

```json Example
"integrations": {
    "osano": "https://cmp.osano.com/2sUB2dqwqdkks/8dqwd-dwd86£-4a9b/osano.js"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

The `SOURCE` can be found as the `src` value in the code snippet generated by Osano. It always starts with `https://cmp.osano.com/`.

```html Code snippet from Osano
<script src="https://cmp.osano.com/placeholder/placeholder/osano.js"/>
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion
  title="Pages not loading with Strict compliance mode"
>
  If your documentation pages aren't loading properly when using Osano's **Strict** compliance mode, you'll need to whitelist Mintlify's domain to allow images and other assets to load.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Managed Rules">
      In your Osano dashboard, go to **Scripts** → **Managed Rules**.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add Mintlify domain">
      Add `.mintlify.app/` as a managed rule.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/integrations/osano-managed-rule.png" alt="Osano managed rule" />
      </Frame>

      <Info>
      This ensures that all Mintlify-served assets (including images, stylesheets, and other documentation resources) are treated as essential and will load even when Osano blocks uncategorized third-party content.
