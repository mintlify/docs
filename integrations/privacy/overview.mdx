## Cookie Consent and Disabling Telemetry

If you need to check if a user has already consented to cookies for GDPR compliance, you can specify a local storage key and value under `cookies`:

```json
  "integrations": {
    "cookies": {
      "key": "LOCAL STORAGE KEY",
      "value": "LOCAL STORAGE VALUE"
    }
  }
```

If these values are set, local storage will be checked to see if the user has consented to cookies. If they have not, telemetry will be disabled.

If you'd like to disable telemetry for all users, you can add the following to your `docs.json` file:

```json
  "integrations": {
    "telemetry": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
```

<Note>
  If you disable telemetry, you cannot collect feedback on your documentation pages, even if you enable feedback in your dashboard.
