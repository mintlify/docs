If you use Mintlify's OpenAPI support for your API reference documentation, add the following to your Stainless config:

```yaml openapi.stainless.yml
openapi:
  code_samples: mintlify
```

Configure the [OpenAPI setup](/api-playground/openapi/setup#in-the-repo) in your Mintlify docs. To integrate Stainless, modify the GitHub Action that uploads your OpenAPI spec to Stainless so that it pushes the Stainless-enhanced OpenAPI spec into your docs repo like so:


```yaml
name: Upload OpenAPI spec to Stainless and (Mintlify) docs repo

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  stainless:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Push spec and config to Stainless and outputs documented spec
        uses: stainless-api/upload-openapi-spec-action@main
        with:
          input_path: 'path/to/my-company-openapi.json'
          config_path: 'path/to/my-company.stainless.yaml'
          output_path: 'path/to/my-company-openapi.documented.json'
          project_name: 'my-stainless-project'
      - name: Push documented spec to docs repo
        uses: dmnemec/copy_file_to_another_repo_action@main
        env:
          API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB }}
        with:
          source_file: 'config/my-company-openapi.documented.json'
          destination_repo: '{DOCS_REPO_NAME}'
          destination_folder: 'openapi-specs' # (optional) the folder in the destination repository to place the file in, if not the root directory
          user_email: '{EMAIL}' # the email associated with the GH token
          user_name: '{USERNAME}' # the username associated with the GH token
          commit_message: 'Auto-updates from Stainless'
```

This assumes the following secrets have been [uploaded to your GitHub Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions):

- `secrets.STAINLESS_API_KEY`: Your Stainless API key.
- `secrets.API_TOKEN_GITHUB`: A GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with permissions to push to your docs repo.
