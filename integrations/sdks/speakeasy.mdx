description: Automate your SDK usage snippets in the API playground

Autogenerated code snippets from Speakeasy SDKs can be integrated directly into Mintlify API reference documentation. SDK usage snippets are shown in the [interactive playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of Mintlify-powered documentation sites.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Mintlify with Speakeasy, you'll need the following:

  - A [Mintlify documentation repository](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart#creating-the-repository).
  - A Speakeasy-generated SDK with a configured [automated code sample URL](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls).

## Setting up the integration

### Get the API's combined spec public URL from the registry

Navigate to the [Speakeasy Dashboard](https://app.speakeasy.com) and open the **API Registry** tab. Open the `*-with-code-samples` entry for the API.

> NOTE: If the entry is not labeled **Combined Spec**, ensure that the API
> has an [automatic code sample
> URL](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls) configured.

From the registry entry's page, copy the provided public URL.

### Update the `mint.json` configuration file 

Add the combined spec URL to **Anchors** or **Tabs** in the `mint.json` file of a Mintlify repository. Anchors are displayed as a list of links on the left side of the documentation, while Tabs are displayed as tabs along the top of the documentation.

Add the combined spec URL to **Anchors** by updating the `anchor` field in the `mint.json` file as follows:

```json mint.json
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add the combined spec URL to **Tabs** by updating the `tab` field in the `mint.json` file as follows:

```json mint.json
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "url": "api-reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL"
    }
  ]
}
```

Speakeasy-generated code snippets can now be viewed in the Mintlify API reference documentation. See the code snippets in action in the [interactive playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of the Mintlify-powered documentation site.

## Next steps

Mintlify offers flexible customization options for API references generated from OpenAPI documents. For more information, refer to the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup).
