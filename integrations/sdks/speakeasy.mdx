Autogenerated code snippets from Speakeasy SDKs can be integrated directly into Mintlify API reference documentation. SDK usage snippets are shown in the [interactive playground](/api-playground/overview) of Mintlify-powered documentation sites.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Mintlify with Speakeasy, you'll need the following:

  - A [Mintlify documentation repository](/quickstart#creating-the-repository).
  - A Speakeasy-generated SDK with a configured [automated code sample URL](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls).

## Setting up the integration

To integrate Speakeasy with Mintlify, you must get the API's combined spec public URL from the registry and update your `docs.json` configuration file.

### Get the API's combined spec public URL from the registry

Navigate to your [Speakeasy Dashboard](https://app.speakeasy.com) and open the **API Registry** tab. Open the `*-with-code-samples` entry for the API.

</Frame>

<Note>
  If the entry is not labeled **Combined Spec**, ensure that the API has an [automatic code sample URL](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/code-samples/automated-code-sample-urls) configured.
</Note>

From the registry entry's page, copy the provided public URL.

### Update your `docs.json` configuration file 

Add the combined spec URL to an **Anchors** or **Tabs** section in your `docs.json` file.

Add the combined spec URL to an anchor by updating the `anchor` field in your `docs.json` file as follows:

```json docs.json
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add the combined spec URL to a tab by updating the `tab` field in the `docs.json` file as follows:

```json docs.json
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "url": "api-reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL"
    }
  ]
}
```

Speakeasy-generated code snippets can now be viewed in your API docs and interacted with in the playground.
