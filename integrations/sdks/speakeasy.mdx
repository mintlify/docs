description: Automate your SDK usage snippets in the API playground
---

You can integrate Speakeasy-generated code snippets from your SDKs directly into your Mintlify API reference documentation. SDK usage snippets are shown in the [interactive playground](/api-playground/overview) of your Mintlify-powered documentation.

## Speakeasy SDK Repository Changes

In your Speakeasy SDK repos, add the following to the `targets` section of your `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` file to ensure code samples are automatically produced alongside SDK generations.

```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    target: typescript
    source: my-source
    codeSamples:
      output: codeSamples.yaml
```

Code samples will be generated in the form of an [OpenAPI overlay file](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/openapi/overlays) that will be used in the Mintlify docs repository.

## Mintlify Docs Repository Changes

The workflow files produced will automatically bundle your source OpenAPI spec and Speakeasy code samples into a single output file, `openapi.yaml`. Mintlify will use this output file when constructing your API reference. 

### Interactive CLI Set Up

Run the following commands to set up the `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` and `.github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml` files through the interactive Speakeasy CLI.

```bash
speakeasy configure sources
speakeasy configure github
```

Set up your source spec. The source spec is the OpenAPI spec that code samples will be generated for, and it's often the same specification used to power Mintlify docs.

![](/images/speakeasy-1.webp)

Add the overlay created by Speakeasy to inject code snippets into your spec.

![](/images/speakeasy-2.webp)

Provide a name and path for the OpenAPI spec. This will be the final spec used by Mintlify.

![](/images/speakeasy-3.webp)

Finally, Add your `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under `Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions`. Find the Speakeasy API key in the Speakeasy dashboard under the **API Keys** tab.

## Manual Set Up

Alternatively, you can manually set up the following files in your Mintlify docs repo.


```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
sources:
  docs-source:
    inputs:
      - location: {{your_api_spec}} # local or remote references supported
    overlays:
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_1}}/codeSamples.yaml
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_2}}/codeSamples.yaml
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_3}}/codeSamples.yaml
    output: openapi.yaml
targets: {}
```

```yaml .speakeasy/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml
name: Generate
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
jobs:
  generate:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/workflow-executor.yaml@v15
    with:
      force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
      mode: pr
      speakeasy_version: latest
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

Finally, make sure you add your `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under `Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions`. Find the Speakeasy API key in the Speakeasy dashboard under the **API Keys** tab.
