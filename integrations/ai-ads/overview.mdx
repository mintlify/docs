AI ads provide a non-intrusive way to monetize your documentation while maintaining user experience. Our AI-powered system analyzes page content and user behavior to display relevant advertisements that add value to your readers.

## How AI ads work

AI ads use machine learning algorithms to:

1. **Analyze content** - Understand the context and topics of each documentation page
2. **Profile users** - Learn from user behavior and preferences (privacy-compliant)
3. **Match relevance** - Display ads that align with user interests and page content
4. **Optimize performance** - Continuously improve ad placement and targeting
