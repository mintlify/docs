Add the following to your `docs.json` file to send analytics to PostHog.

You only need to include `apiHost` if you are self-hosting PostHog. We send events to `https://app.posthog.com` by default.

<CodeGroup>

```json Analytics options in docs.json
integrations: {
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "required",
        "apiHost": "optional"
    }
}
```

```json Example
integrations: {
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "phc_TXdpocbYTeZVm5VJmMzHTMrCofBQu3e0kN7HGMNGTVW"
    }
}
```

<Warning>
    Enabling PostHog analytics will disable the analytics on the Mintlify dashboard.

## Session Recordings

You need to add the URL for your docs website to Posthog's "Authorized domains for recordings" before you can receive session recordings. The option to add your URL is in Posthog's project settings.
