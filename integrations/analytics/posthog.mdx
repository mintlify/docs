Add the following to your `docs.json` file to send analytics to PostHog.

You only need to include `apiHost` if you are self-hosting PostHog. We send events to `https://app.posthog.com` by default.

<CodeGroup>

```json Analytics options in docs.json
"integrations": {
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "YOUR_POSTHOG_PROJECT_API_KEY",
        "apiHost": "optional",
        "sessionRecording": true
    }
}
```

```json Example
"integrations": {
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "phc_TXdpocbYTeZVm5VJmMzHTMrCofBQu3e0kN7HGMNGTVW"
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Configuration options

<ParamField path="apiKey" type="string" required>
  Your PostHog project API key. Must start with `phc_`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="apiHost" type="string">
  The URL of your PostHog instance. Only required if you are self-hosting PostHog. Defaults to `https://app.posthog.com`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sessionRecording" type="boolean" default="true">
  Enable or disable session recording. Set to `false` to disable session recordings while keeping analytics enabled.
</ParamField>

<br />

<Warning>
    Enabling PostHog analytics will disable the analytics on the Mintlify dashboard.
</Warning>

## Session recordings

Session recordings are enabled by default when you configure PostHog. To disable session recordings while keeping analytics enabled, set `sessionRecording` to `false` in your configuration.

```json Disable session recordings
"integrations": {
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "phc_your-key",
        "sessionRecording": false
    }
}
```

You need to add the URL for your docs website to PostHog's "Authorized domains for recordings" before you can receive session recordings. The option to add your URL is in PostHog's project settings.
