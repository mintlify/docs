Add the following to your `docs.json` file to send analytics to Mixpanel.

```json Analytics options in docs.json
"integrations": {
    "mixpanel": {
        "projectToken": "YOUR_MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN"
    }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN` with your Mixpanel project token. You can find this in your [Mixpanel project settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project).

## Tracked events

Mintlify automatically tracks the following user interactions:

- Page views
- Search queries
- Feedback submissions
- Context menu interactions
- Navigation clicks

If you're not seeing events in Mixpanel, ensure your project token is correct and that no content security policies are blocking the Mixpanel script.
