```json docs.json
"integrations": {
    "ga4": {
        "measurementId": "G-XXXXXXX"
    }
}
```

### Wait

Google Analytics takes two to three days to show your data.

You can use of [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en) to check analytics are enabled correctly. The extension will log to your browser's console every time GA4 makes a request.
