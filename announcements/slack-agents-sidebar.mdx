## What's new

`@mintlify` and `@kb` are now Slack agents available in your sidebar.

Chat with the agent directly from the Slack sidebar while you work. No need to switch channels or open a new conversation—the agent is always accessible from the side panel.

## How to use it

1. Open Slack and look for the agent in your sidebar.
2. Click on `@mintlify` or `@kb` to start a conversation.
3. Chat with the agent while browsing other channels.

## Why this matters

- **Faster access**: Get documentation help without leaving your current context.
- **Parallel workflows**: Post in channels while chatting with the agent on the side.
- **Team knowledge**: Capture and update documentation from any conversation.
