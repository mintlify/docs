## What is the difference between mint.json and docs.json?

In the `mint.json`, the navigation was defined by both the `navigation` field AND the `tabs`, `anchors`, and `versions` fields.
All these fields were related to each other and had to be mapped together.

In the `docs.json`, the navigation is solely defined by the `navigation` field.

For example, here is a `mint.json` and its equivalent `docs.json`

<CodeGroup>

```json mint.json
{
  "tabs": [{
    "name": "Components",
    "url": "content"
  },
  {
    "name": "Integrations",
    "url": "integrations"
  }],
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Components",
      "pages": [
        "content/components/accordions",
        "content/components/accordion-groups",
        "content/components/callouts",
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "API Components",
      "pages": [
        "content/components/params",
        "content/components/responses",
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "Analytics",
      "pages": [
        "integrations/analytics/overview",
        "integrations/analytics/amplitude",
        "integrations/analytics/clearbit",
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "SDKs",
      "pages": ["integrations/sdks/providers", "integrations/sdks/clients"]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [{
      "tab": "Components",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Components",
          "pages": [
            "content/components/accordions",
            "content/components/accordion-groups",
            "content/components/callouts",
            ...
          ]
        },
        {
          "group": "API Components",
          "pages": [
            "content/components/params",
            "content/components/responses",
            ...
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "tab": "Integrations",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Analytics",
          "pages": [
            "integrations/analytics/overview",
            "integrations/analytics/amplitude",
            "integrations/analytics/clearbit",
            ...
          ]
        },
        {
          "group": "SDKs",
          "pages": ["integrations/sdks/providers", "integrations/sdks/clients"]
        }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```

In the above `mint.json` example, the navigation is one combined array of groups and the tabs are a separate array.
The tabs serve to group the groups in the navigation. This isn't very intuitive and it's hard to manage.

In the `docs.json` there is no separation between tabs, groups, and pages - they are integrated into one large recursive structure.
So it is very obvious how the groups are grouped into tabs.

## What functionality does docs.json unlock?

Tabs and anchors are no longer restricted to a single folder of the same name. Previously with mint.json a tab had to correlate with a folder in the file tree.
Now you can have a tab with an assortment of files in different folders.

<CodeGroup>

```json mint.json
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "Tab 1",
      "url": "some-folder"
    },
    {
      "name": "Tab 2",
      "url": "some-other-folder"
    }
  ],
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Group in Tab 1",
      "pages": [
        "some-folder/file-1", // Notice how we're restricted to the folder name
        "some-folder/file-2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "Group in Tab 2",
      "pages": ["some-other-folder/file-1", "some-other-folder/file-2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Tab 1",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Group 1",
            "pages": [
              "some-folder/file-1",
              "another-folder/file-2"
              "just-a-file"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      {
        "tab": "Tab 2",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Group 2",
            "pages": [
              "some-other-folder/file-1",
              "various-different-folders/file-2",
              "another-file"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

All the benefits we've been discussing with tabs is applicable for versions, anchors, languages, and dropdowns.
And you can now arbitrarily mix and nest any combination of these divisions.

This gives a lot of freedom for you to pick and choose the hierarchy you want - either tabs or anchors can be on the highest level.

Here is a complex example that includes all the different types of divisions - versions, anchors, languages, and dropdowns.

Now you can have versions applied to only a specific tab and reference tabs at one layer and then reference them again
further down the hierarchy.

```json docs.json [expandable]
{
  "languages": [
    {
      "language": "en",
      "tabs": [
        {
          "tab": "Guides",
          "pages": ["en/overview", "en/quickstart"]
        },
        {
          "tab": "SDKs",
          "versions": [
            {
              "version": "latest",
              "anchors": [
                {
                  "anchor": "Javascript",
                  "pages": [
                    "en/sdk/js/create",
                    "en/sdk/js/edit",
                    "en/sdk/js/delete"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "anchor": "Python",
                  "pages": [
                    "en/sdk/py/create",
                    "en/sdk/py/edit",
                    "en/sdk/py/delete"
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "language": "es",
      "tabs": [
        {
          "tab": "Guías",
          "pages": ["es/overview", "es/quickstart"]
        },
        {
          "tab": "SDKs",
          "versions": [
            {
              "version": "último",
              "anchors": [
                {
                  "anchor": "Javascript",
                  "pages": [
                    "es/sdk/js/create",
                    "es/sdk/js/edit",
                    "es/sdk/js/delete"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "anchor": "Python",
                  "pages": [
                    "es/sdk/py/create",
                    "es/sdk/py/edit",
                    "es/sdk/py/delete"
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
