title: Localization
---

`"languages"` in your `docs.json` can be leveraged to partition your navigation into different languages.

We currently support localization in English (`en`), Chinese (`cn`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), Japanese (`jp`), Portuguese (`pt`), Portuguese (Brazil) (`pt-BR`), and German (`de`).

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "languages": [
      {
        "language": "en",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["en/overview", "en/quickstart", "en/development"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "language": "es",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["es/overview", "es/quickstart", "es/development"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
