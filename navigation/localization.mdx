title: "Localization"

`"languages"` in your `docs.json` can be leveraged to partition your navigation into different languages.

We currently support localization in the following languages:

- Arabic (`ar`)
- Chinese (`cn` or `zh`, `zh-Hans` for Simplified and `zh-Hant` for Traditional)
- English (`en`)
- French (`fr`)
- German (`de`)
- Indonesian (`id`)
- Italian (`it`)
- Japanese (`jp` or `ja`)
- Korean (`ko`)
- Portuguese (`pt`)
- Portuguese (Brazil) (`pt-BR`)
- Russian (`ru`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- Turkish (`tr`)

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "languages": [
      {
        "language": "en",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["en/overview", "en/quickstart", "en/development"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "language": "es",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["es/overview", "es/quickstart", "es/development"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
