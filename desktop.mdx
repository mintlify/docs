The desktop app provides a native application for managing your documentation with the convenience of local editing and the power of online publishing.

- **No CLI required**: Edit and preview documentation without installing Node.js or the CLI.
- **Visual editing**: Write using a WYSIWYG editor with instant preview of your changes.
- **Git integration**: Seamlessly sync with your Git repository to maintain version control.
- **Offline capable**: Work on your documentation even without an internet connection.
- **Online publishing**: Deploy changes directly to production when connected.

## Getting started

### Open your documentation

After signing in, you'll see a list of your documentation repositories.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a repository">
    Choose the repository you want to work on from your list of available documentation projects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your branch">
    Select the branch you want to edit. Create a new branch to preview changes before they go live, or work directly on your deployment branch.
    
    <Tip>
      Working on a separate branch lets you preview changes before deploying to production.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start editing">
    Navigate to an existing file in the sidebar or create a new one to begin editing your documentation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Preview your documentation

The desktop app includes a built-in preview that updates in real-time as you edit.

Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Windows to toggle the preview panel.

<Info>
  The preview uses the same rendering engine as your live documentation, so what you see is what your users will see.
</Info>

## Working offline

The desktop app supports offline editing when you don't have an internet connection.

### What works offline

- **Editing content**: Create and modify documentation pages
- **Local preview**: View your changes in real-time
- **File management**: Create, rename, and delete files
- **Navigation editing**: Update your `docs.json` configuration

### What requires internet

- **Initial repository clone**: First-time setup requires downloading your documentation
- **Publishing changes**: Deploying updates to your live site
- **Syncing with remote**: Pulling latest changes from your team
- **Authentication**: Signing in or refreshing your session

<Tip>
  Changes made offline are automatically queued and will sync when you reconnect to the internet.
</Tip>

## Publishing changes

Publishing from the desktop app works the same way as the web editor.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your changes">
    Check the files you've modified in the changes panel. The app highlights all edited, added, or deleted files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your work">
    Select **Save Changes** to commit your edits locally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    - **Deployment branch**: Select **Publish** to deploy directly to your live site.
    - **Other branches**: Select **Create Pull Request** to propose your changes for review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor features

The desktop app includes the same powerful editing features as the web editor.

### Visual and Markdown modes

Toggle between visual mode for WYSIWYG editing and Markdown mode for direct access to `MDX` code.

Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows to switch modes.
