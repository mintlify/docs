openapi: POST /agent/{projectId}/job
keywords: ["agent job", "create", "automation", "automate"]
---

This endpoint creates an agent job based on provided messages and branch information. The job executes asynchronously and returns a streaming response with the execution details and results.

If a branch doesn't exist, the agent creates one. If files are edited successfully, a draft pull request is automatically created at the end of the job.

The agent can be triggered from multiple sources including the dashboard, Slack, GitHub pull request comments, or direct API calls. When triggered from GitHub pull requests via `@mintlify` mentions, the `source` field is automatically set to `github`.

## Rate limits

The agent API has the following limits:

- 100 uses per Mintlify project per hour

## Suggested usage

For best results, use the [useChat hook from ai-sdk](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#usechat) to send requests and handle responses.
