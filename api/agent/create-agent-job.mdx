This endpoint creates an agent job based on provided messages and branch information. The job executes asynchronously and returns a streaming response with the execution details and results.

If a branch doesn't exist, the agent creates one. If files are edited successfully, a draft pull request is automatically created at the end of the job.

## Rate limits

The agent API has the following limits:

- 100 uses per Mintlify project per hour

## Suggested usage
