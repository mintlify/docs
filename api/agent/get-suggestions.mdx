## Usage

Use this endpoint to retrieve agent [suggestions](/agent/suggestions) for your documentation project. The agent analyzes pull requests and assistant conversations to surface recommended documentation changes.

Use the `page` and `limit` query parameters to paginate through the results. The results are sorted by creation date with the newest suggestions first.
