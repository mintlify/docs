## Usage

Use this endpoint to export user feedback collected from your documentation. Feedback includes contextual feedback from page ratings and code snippet feedback.

Paginate through results using the `cursor` parameter returned in the response. Continue fetching while `hasMore` is `true`.

## Filtering

Filter feedback by:
- **Date range**: Use `dateFrom` and `dateTo` to limit results to a specific time period
- **Source**: Filter by `code_snippet` or `contextual` feedback types
- **Status**: Filter by status values like `pending`, `in_progress`, `resolved`, or `dismissed`

## Response types

The response contains different feedback types based on the source:

- **Contextual feedback**: Includes `helpful` boolean and optional `contact` email
- **Code snippet feedback**: Includes `code`, `filename`, and `lang` fields
