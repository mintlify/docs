---

Trigger an autopilot analysis of a pull request to determine if documentation updates are needed. The autopilot uses an agentic workflow to analyze the PR changes, explore your codebase and documentation, and create suggestions when updates are required.

## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.mintlify.com/v1/autopilot/:subdomain/suggestions/check
```

## Authentication

Use your [admin API key](/api-reference/introduction#admin-api-key) in the Authorization header.

## Path parameters

<Fields>
  <Field name="subdomain" type="string" required>
    The subdomain of your documentation site
  </Field>
</Fields>

## Request body

<Fields>
  <Field name="owner" type="string" required>
    The GitHub repository owner (organization or user)
  </Field>
  <Field name="repo" type="string" required>
    The GitHub repository name
  </Field>
  <Field name="pullRequestNumber" type="number" required>
    The pull request number to analyze
  </Field>
</Fields>

## Response

<Fields>
  <Field name="status" type="string">
    Returns `"queued"` when the analysis has been successfully queued
  </Field>
</Fields>

## How it works

When you trigger a PR check, the autopilot:

1. Fetches the pull request details from GitHub
2. Uses an agentic workflow with tools to:
   - Read the PR diff and changes
   - Explore files in your code repository
   - Review your current documentation structure
   - Analyze the navigation and organization
3. Determines if documentation updates are needed based on the changes
4. Creates a suggestion in your autopilot dashboard if updates are required

The analysis runs asynchronously. Check your [autopilot dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) to view suggestions created from the analysis.

## Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mintlify.com/v1/autopilot/my-docs/suggestions/check \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mint_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "owner": "acme-corp",
    "repo": "api-server",
    "pullRequestNumber": 123
  }'
```
