Use this endpoint to perform semantic searches across your documentation. The search API uses AI to understand the intent behind queries and return relevant results based on meaning, not just keyword matching.

## Use cases

- Build custom search interfaces for your documentation
- Integrate documentation search into your application
- Create AI-powered chatbots that can search your docs
- Implement context-aware help systems

## Search behavior

The search endpoint:
- Performs semantic search using AI to understand query intent
- Returns results ranked by relevance
- Searches across all indexed pages in your documentation
- Respects your documentation's navigation structure
- Provides context snippets for each result

## Best practices
