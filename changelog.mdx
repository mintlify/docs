<Update label="August 16" tags={["Improvements"]} rss={{ title: "Weekly Updates", description: "Performance optimizations, LLM integrations, web editor polish, and API playground enhancements" }}>
  ## Performance and build optimizations

  - MDX transpilation now happens at deployment time instead of on every page load in uncached NextJS serverless environments, improving time to first byte for uncached pages.
  - Content-based hashing prevents re-transpilation when MDX hasn't changed, reducing update workflow times by ~50% for customers with large page counts (deployments over 5 minutes should be roughly halved)
  - Preview deployment viewing in the dashboard is now faster with added database indexes and query parallelization in our backend
  - Reduced page size by eliminating duplicate `navigation` data in each page's `rsc` payload—performance gains most noticeable with high page counts or complex navigation structures
  - More aggressive prefetching enables instant page loads more frequently

  ## API playground and OpenAPI enhancements

  - OpenAPI to MCP conversion moved to backend, enabling hosted MCP servers to contain tools (expect clearer documentation and config options soon)
  - Added Ruby support to API playground
  - We added a feature such that you can now [specify API pages using just your docs.json](/api-playground/openapi-setup#auto-populate-api-pages) without creating any new mdx files.
  - Support for [`webhook pages`](/api-playground/openapi-setup#webhooks) in docs navigation from OpenAPI specs
  - Optimized AI model context by removing anchor link specifications from markdown links when navigating to Anthropic, OpenAI, or other providers

  ## Web editor improvements

  - File creation/renaming now saves changes when clicking away instead of requiring Enter key press
  - Fixed branch navigation where changing URL to specific branch would redirect to last active branch instead of intended destination
  - Properly URL encode branch titles containing `/` to prevent navigation breakage
  - Fixed `Ctrl+K` link shortcut in monorepo dashboard Editor that was prepending docs repo path and creating broken links

  ## Analytics and LLM integrations

  - Custom `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` support—add to docs repo root to serve at `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` endpoints for LLM customization
  - Added [Hightouch analytics integration](/integrations/analytics/hightouch#hightouch)
  - Enhanced context menu analytics tracking (dashboard viewing coming soon)
  - Added e2e tests for `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` to ensure correct serving

  ## Component and styling enhancements

  ## Authentication improvements

  - Group-level public access: make entire page groups public via `docs.json` so you don’t need `public: true` on each page ([learn more](https://mintlify.com/docs/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup#group-level))
  - Support [`logoutURL in OAuth configuration`](https://mintlify.com/docs/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup#implementation-3) to delete upstream cookies and complete sign-out
  - On OAuth errors, users are redirected to your specified `logoutURL` to restart the auth flow
  - Fixed a flash of a 500 error during OAuth/JWT flows before the callback
  - Auto-strip `https://` from URLs in OAuth/JWT auth configuration to prevent misconfiguration

  ## API playground enhancements

  - New [Search API endpoint](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-reference/assistant/search) so you can build agents and MCP servers on top of your docs

  - Fixed accessibility of nested `/mcp/...` pages after the [hosted MCP servers release](https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/model-context-protocol#accessing-your-mcp-server) from last week

  ## Performance and reliability

  - All image and video assets present in your docs repo are now served at the appropriate path on your domain. For example, if you have `/assets/marketing/my-logo.png` in your repo, it will be available at `https://mydocsurl.extension/assets/marketing/my-logo.png`.
  - Email field on login for the Mintlify dashboard now autofocuses so you can start typing immediately _(quality of life improvement)_
  - Both custom domains and subdomains in Redis for a performance improvement on navigation load times (~50ms latency reduction)
  - Added retry logic for PDF exports to improve reliability
  - Fixed cookie consent popup reappearing after acceptance or dismissal—first selection is now respected
  - Fixed copying a page to clipboard on Safari by specifying a MIME `type` in `navigator.write`

  ## Technical improvements

  We've revamped our web editor so that you can now update docs with a fully WYSIWYG experience, while syncing with markdown.

  Check out our [docs on getting started with Web Editor](/editor).

  ## /llms.txt support

  <Frame>
    ![llms.txt support](/images/changelog/llms.jpg)
  </Frame>
  All docs instances are now automatically hosted at /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt so that LLMs can easily ingest your documentation. For more information, read the [docs on the new llms.txt standard.](https://llmstxt.org)

  ## Localization

  You can now localize your docs which operates similarly to versioning. Add a `locale` to a version and fixed content in Mintlify like "Was this page helpful?" will also match the locale.

  ### Quality Improvements

  - Return chat & search results based on the current version that the user is reading
  - Authenticate users with OAuth, in addition to JWT or Shared Session tokens.

  ## Code Line Highlighting

  You can now highlight lines of code in your docs to emphasize and bring attention to important parts by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces `{}` and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

  ```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3,4,5}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```

  ````mdx
  ```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```
  ````

  ## Light mode code blocks

  Code blocks now have a light mode variant which can be enabled by adding the following to your `docs.json`:

  ```json
  "codeBlock": {
    "mode": "auto"
  }
  ```

  ## Advanced Footer

  <Frame>
    ![Advanced Footer](/images/changelog/advanced-footer.gif)

  You can now add more links to the standard footer. This upgrade provides more consistency between landing pages and docs, or greater customization if you want to spotlight specific pages like socials or status logs.

  ## Filter search based on the current user

  When personalization is enabled, search results are now filtered based on the current logged in user so that they only see the relevant content.
