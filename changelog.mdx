You can add this AI-powered chatbot to any web page: your landing page, inside your product, or on your existing documentation pages — **Learn more [here](https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/widget/chat#installation)**.
- **New Pricing Plan**: We also updated our pricing plans for better customizability and scale — **Read the blog announcement [here](https://mintlify.com/blog/pro-plan)**.

## LAUNCH WEEK III

- **Themes**: Themes enables you to transform the styling and layout of your documentation to fit your branding. We've unveiled three themes: **[Quill](https://starter-quill.mintlify.app/), [Prism](https://starter-prism.mintlify.app/), and [Venus](https://starter-venus.mintlify.app/).**
- **Search V2**: Upgraded UI, indexing OpenAPI endpoints, removing hidden pages from search, indexing support for components.
- **Web Editor Branching**: Our web editor allows users to alter your docs content right on the web without an IDE. Branches allow you to create separate versions of your documentation without affecting the main project — they're like parallel universes for code.
- **User Auth**: When writing documentation, you may want to limit which user guides are shown to your customers. With User Auth, identify your users and tailor your docs content to them.
- **OpenAPI Automations**: When you're constantly shipping changes to your API, it's important to reflect those changes in your documentation ASAP. Our revamped setup makes autogenerating your API Reference docs seamless, removing the need for any manual labor to reflect changes in production

### Improvements 💎

- **Dashboard Updates**: We've upgraded the navbar to more readily access support, GitHub app configuration, and user management. Also, we've updated logs to see exactly what was changed and the status of an update. Now, when you make an unsuccessful update, we'll tell you exactly what went wrong.
