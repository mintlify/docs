<Update label="August 17 - August 23" tags={["Improvements"]} rss={{ title: "Weekly Updates", description: "Image layout fixes, auth enhancements, mobile nav improvements, and web editor stability" }}>

## Image handling improvements

- **Major improvement**: Images no longer cause layout shift by default, even when width and height attributes aren't specified—automatic sizing prevents content jumping during page loads
- All static files in your repository (PDF, TXT, XML, etc.) are now automatically uploaded and served when you deploy, providing complete asset coverage

## Web editor and deployment enhancements

- Fixed branch creation workflow in web editor to correctly navigate to and stay on newly created branches
- Enhanced merge conflict dialog with proper escape functionality, no more page reloads required to dismiss conflicts
- Optimized update workflow performance by cache-invalidating only changed pages during partial updates, reducing deployment times

## Authentication and navigation improvements

- New support for authentication on custom subdirectories, if you serve docs at `https://yourdomain.com/docs`, authentication now works seamlessly
- Fixed sidebar display bug that incorrectly showed when only one link was configured
- Comprehensive mobile navigation overhaul: centered buttons with proper margin/padding, improved spacing in dropdown menus, removed unnecessary dividers and margins for empty sections, and fixed Maple theme gap/padding issues

## Component and styling fixes

</Update>

<Update label="August 10 - August 16" tags={["Improvements"]} rss={{ title: "Weekly Updates", description: "Performance optimizations, LLM integrations, web editor polish, and API playground enhancements" }}>

## Performance and build optimizations

- MDX transpilation now happens at deployment time instead of on every page load in uncached NextJS serverless environments, improving time to first byte for uncached pages.
- Content-based hashing prevents re-transpilation when MDX hasn't changed, reducing update workflow times by ~50% for customers with large page counts (deployments over 5 minutes should be roughly halved)
- Preview deployment viewing in the dashboard is now faster with added database indexes and query parallelization in our backend
- Reduced page size by eliminating duplicate `navigation` data in each page's `rsc` payload—performance gains most noticeable with high page counts or complex navigation structures
- More aggressive prefetching enables instant page loads more frequently

## API playground and OpenAPI enhancements

- OpenAPI to MCP conversion moved to backend, enabling hosted MCP servers to contain tools (expect clearer documentation and config options soon)
- Added Ruby support to API playground
- We added a feature such that you can now [specify API pages using just your docs.json](/api-playground/openapi-setup#auto-populate-api-pages) without creating any new mdx files.
- Support for [`webhook` pages](/api-playground/openapi-setup#webhooks) in docs navigation from OpenAPI specs
- Optimized AI model context by removing anchor link specifications from markdown links when navigating to Anthropic, OpenAI, or other providers

## Web editor improvements

- File creation/renaming now saves changes when clicking away instead of requiring Enter key press
- Fixed branch navigation where changing URL to specific branch would redirect to last active branch instead of intended destination
- Properly URL encode branch titles containing `/` to prevent navigation breakage
- Fixed `Ctrl+K` link shortcut in monorepo dashboard Editor that was prepending docs repo path and creating broken links

## Analytics and LLM integrations

- Custom `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` support—add to docs repo root to serve at `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` endpoints for LLM customization
- Added [Hightouch analytics integration](/integrations/analytics/hightouch#hightouch)
- Enhanced context menu analytics tracking (dashboard viewing coming soon)
- Added e2e tests for `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` to ensure correct serving

## Component and styling enhancements

- Support for custom classnames in `h{1-4}` tags for applying custom heading styles
- Fixed `h{1-4}` tags rendering as `Heading` components with chips in custom page mode
- Added CSS selectors to [breadcrumbs](/navigation#breadcrumbs) for custom CSS targeting
- Fixed stretched open-graph images by analyzing dimensions to maintain proportions at 56px height
- Corrected `VSCode` to `VS Code` in contextual menu when enabled
- Fixed headings within custom components appearing in table of contents alongside semantic headings

## Bug fixes and reliability

- Fixed PDF render issues with certain page titles by sanitizing characters that cause generation problems
- Resolved CLI error `Cannot convert undefined or null to object` when encountering empty OpenAPI JSON files
- Fixed custom `docs.json` open-graph metatags being overwritten by generated ones
- Fixed RSS feed button clicks when landing on anchor links by using origin + pathname for RSS links
- Improved CLI download speed by removing sourcemaps

## Technical improvements

- Added visual tests to CI pipeline for earlier regression detection
- Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
- Comprehensive testing coverage for new features and edge cases

  - Support [`logoutURL` in OAuth configuration](https://mintlify.com/docs/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup#implementation-3) to delete upstream cookies and complete sign-out
  - On OAuth errors, users are redirected to your specified `logoutURL` to restart the auth flow
  - Fixed a flash of a 500 error during OAuth/JWT flows before the callback
  - Auto-strip `https://` from URLs in OAuth/JWT auth configuration to prevent misconfiguration

  ## API playground enhancements

  - New [Search API endpoint](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-reference/assistant/search) so you can build agents and MCP servers on top of your docs
  - `openapi` and `asyncapi` files are now served at their specified paths (e.g. `https://mydocsurl.extension/{openapi-or-file-name}.json`)
  - You can now use the [`x-mint` field in your openapi files](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup#x-mint-extension) to override generated fields, customize preface content, or change endpoint URLs in code samples
  - [`x-mcp` is now `x-mint.mcp`](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup#mcp) in OpenAPI configurations to control which routes are exposed as MCP tools

  ## Assistant updates

  - Fixed accessibility of nested `/mcp/...` pages after the [hosted MCP servers release](https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/model-context-protocol#accessing-your-mcp-server) from last week

  ## Performance and reliability

  - All image and video assets present in your docs repo are now served at the appropriate path on your domain. For example, if you have `/assets/marketing/my-logo.png` in your repo, it will be available at `https://mydocsurl.extension/assets/marketing/my-logo.png`.
  - Email field on login for the Mintlify dashboard now autofocuses so you can start typing immediately _(quality of life improvement)_
  - Both custom domains and subdomains in Redis for a performance improvement on navigation load times (~50ms latency reduction)
  - Added retry logic for PDF exports to improve reliability
  - Fixed cookie consent popup reappearing after acceptance or dismissal—first selection is now respected
  - Fixed copying a page to clipboard on Safari by specifying a MIME `type` in `navigator.write`

  ## Technical improvements

  - CLI bugfixes for windows and pnpm, plus CI tests to prevent regressions
  - Improved error logging output—a quality of life upgrade for our engineering team when debugging
  - Minor fixes to the broken-link CI action when `contentDirectory` files are missing
  - Fixed a regression caused by the auth-protected preview fixes from last week where the active tab was not being set correctly in the navigation UI
  - Fixed theme light background color not being applied to active tab icons
  - Fixed an issue where changing the auth type in the dashboard would update and then flip back to the previously saved type—now the new selection persists after saving
  - Internal DX improvements for enterprise customers with custom UI libraries—it's now easier for us to include your components and accommodate requests on shorter timelines
