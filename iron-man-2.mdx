## Overview

Iron Man 2 (2010) is the sequel to Iron Man and the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It follows Tony Stark as he faces new challenges both from within and from external threats.

## Plot summary

### The Stark legacy

Six months after revealing his identity as Iron Man, Tony Stark has become a worldwide celebrity. The U.S. government demands he hand over the Iron Man suit, but Tony refuses, claiming it as his own property and that no one else could successfully replicate it.

### The palladium problem

Tony discovers that the palladium core in his arc reactor is slowly poisoning him. Unable to find a replacement element, he begins behaving recklessly, believing his death is imminent.

### New threats emerge

**Ivan Vanko**, a Russian physicist whose father worked with Tony's father Howard Stark, builds his own arc reactor and attacks Tony at the Monaco Grand Prix using electrified whips.

**Justin Hammer**, a rival weapons manufacturer, fakes Vanko's death and recruits him to build weaponized suits to compete with Stark Industries.

### SHIELD intervention

Nick Fury and SHIELD agent Natasha Romanoff (undercover as Tony's assistant) reveal that Howard Stark was a SHIELD founder. They provide Tony with his father's old research, which contains the key to synthesizing a new element to replace the palladium.

### Resolution

Tony successfully creates the new element and cures himself. At the Stark Expo, Vanko attacks with an army of weaponized drones and his own upgraded suit. Tony and his friend James Rhodes (wearing the War Machine armor) defeat Vanko and his drones.

The film concludes with Tony being deemed unsuitable for the Avengers Initiative as a member, though Fury notes he would be valuable as a consultant.
