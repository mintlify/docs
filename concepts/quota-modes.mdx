# Quota modes

Spotify applications operate in different quota modes that determine API access limits and user capacity. Understanding these modes helps you plan your application development and scaling.

## Development mode

All new applications start in development mode.

### Features

- Access for up to 25 users
- Standard API rate limits
- Full API access for testing
- User management in Developer Dashboard

### Limitations

- Limited to 25 Spotify accounts
- Must manually add each user in Dashboard
- Not suitable for public release
- Lower rate limits than extended mode

### Use cases

Development mode is perfect for:
- Building and testing your application
- Proof of concept development
- Internal tools with limited users
- Learning the API

## Extended quota mode

Request extended quota when you're ready to launch publicly or need higher limits.

### Features

- No user limit
- Higher API rate limits
- Suitable for production apps
- Public availability

### Requirements

To request extended quota:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build and test your app">
    Complete development and testing in development mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit extension request">
    Go to your app in the Developer Dashboard and request extended quota.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide app details">
    Describe your app, use case, and expected user base.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Spotify reviews your request (typically takes a few days).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive approval">
    Once approved, your app can serve unlimited users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Application review

Spotify reviews apps based on:

- Adherence to [API Terms of Service](https://developer.spotify.com/terms)
- Legitimate use case
- User experience quality
- Data privacy practices
- App completeness and polish

<Warning>
Apps that violate terms of service or provide poor user experience may be rejected or revoked.
</Warning>

## Comparing modes

| Feature | Development | Extended |
|---------|------------|----------|
| User limit | 25 | Unlimited |

| Public release | No | Yes |
| Setup | Automatic | Requires approval |
| User management | Manual | Automatic |

## Managing users in development mode

Add users to your development mode app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Open your app in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to User Management">
    Click on "User Management" in the app settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add users">
    Enter Spotify email addresses or usernames to grant access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Users can authorize">
    Added users can now authorize your app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rate limits by mode

Rate limits vary by quota mode:

### Development mode

- Lower request limits per time window
- Sufficient for testing and small-scale use
- Helps prevent accidental overuse during development

### Extended mode

- Higher request limits
- Suitable for production traffic
- Scales with your user base

<Tip>
Monitor your rate limit usage in the Developer Dashboard to understand if you need extended quota.
