# Track relinking

Track relinking ensures users can play tracks even when the specific recording isn't available in their market. The API automatically substitutes alternative versions when needed.

## What is track relinking?

Track relinking occurs when:
- A track isn't available in a user's market
- An alternative version of the same song exists
- The API automatically links to the available version

This provides a seamless experience across different markets without breaking playback.

## How it works

When you request track information with a market parameter:

```bash
curl "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6?market=ES" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

If the track isn't available in Spain (ES), the API may return a relinked version:

```json
{
  "id": "6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6",
  "name": "Track Name",
  "is_playable": true,
  "linked_from": {
    "id": "original_track_id",
    "uri": "spotify:track:original_track_id"
  },
  "available_markets": ["ES", "FR", "DE", ...]
}
```

## Response fields

<ResponseField name="is_playable" type="boolean">
  Whether the track can be played in the specified market
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="linked_from" type="object">
  Present when track is relinked. Contains the originally requested track ID.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="linked_from.id" type="string">
  The ID of the originally requested track
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="restrictions" type="object">
  Present when track has restrictions. Contains the reason.
</ResponseField>

## Market parameter

Always include the `market` parameter for accurate availability:

```javascript
// Good: Include market
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/id?market=US',
  { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }}
);

// Better: Use user's market
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/id?market=from_token',
  { headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }}
);
```

### Market values

- **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code**: Country code like "US", "GB", "ES"
- **from_token**: Use market associated with user's account (requires user authentication)

## Handling relinked tracks

Check for relinking in your code:

```javascript
function getTrackInfo(track) {
  if (track.linked_from) {
    console.log(`Track ${track.linked_from.id} relinked to ${track.id}`);
  }
  
  if (!track.is_playable) {
    console.log('Track not available in this market');
    return null;
  }
  
  return {
    id: track.id,
    name: track.name,
    originalId: track.linked_from?.id
  };
}
```

## Playback considerations

When controlling playback, always use the returned track ID, not the originally requested ID:

```javascript
async function playTrack(requestedTrackId, market, token) {
  // Get track info with market
  const track = await getTrack(requestedTrackId, market, token);
  
  if (!track.is_playable) {
    throw new Error('Track not playable in market');
  }
  
  // Use the returned ID (may be relinked)
  await startPlayback([track.id], token);
}
```

## Alternative versions

Tracks may have multiple versions due to:

- Different release markets
- Remastered versions
- Regional licensing
- Compilation albums vs original albums

The API automatically selects the best available version for the specified market.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always include market parameter">
    Provide a market parameter to get accurate playability information and enable relinking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check is_playable">
    Always verify `is_playable` is true before attempting playback.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Store track URIs, not IDs">
    URIs remain more consistent across markets than IDs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle unavailable tracks gracefully">
    Provide fallback behavior when tracks aren't available.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Building a playlist player

```javascript
async function playPlaylist(playlistId, market, token) {
  // Get playlist tracks
  const playlist = await getPlaylist(playlistId, market, token);
  
  // Filter playable tracks
  const playableTracks = playlist.tracks.items
    .map(item => item.track)
    .filter(track => track.is_playable)
    .map(track => track.uri);
  
  if (playableTracks.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('No playable tracks in this market');
  }
  
  // Start playback with available tracks
  await startPlayback(playableTracks, token);
  
  // Warn about unavailable tracks
  const unavailableCount = playlist.tracks.total - playableTracks.length;
  if (unavailableCount > 0) {
    console.log(`${unavailableCount} tracks not available in your market`);
  }
}
```
