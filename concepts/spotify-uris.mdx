# Spotify URIs and IDs

Spotify uses URIs and IDs to uniquely identify resources like tracks, albums, artists, and playlists. Understanding these identifiers is essential for working with the API.

## Spotify URIs

Spotify URIs follow this format:

```
spotify:type:id
```

### Examples

<CodeGroup>
```text Track
spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6
```

```text Album
spotify:album:6akEFxtuNf3S1WLJHAVHSl
```

```text Artist
spotify:artist:0OdUWJ0sBjDrqHygGUXeCF
```

```text Playlist
spotify:playlist:37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
```

```text User
spotify:user:spotify
```
</CodeGroup>

## Spotify IDs

Spotify IDs are the unique identifier portion of a URI:

- Format: 22-character base-62 alphanumeric string
- Example: `6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6`

### Using IDs in API calls

Most API endpoints use IDs rather than full URIs:

```bash
# Using ID
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6

# Not URI
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6
```

## Converting between URIs and IDs

Extract ID from URI:

```javascript
function getIdFromUri(uri) {
  return uri.split(':')[2];
}

const uri = 'spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6';
const id = getIdFromUri(uri); // '6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6'
```

Create URI from ID:

```javascript
function createUri(type, id) {
  return `spotify:${type}:${id}`;
}

const uri = createUri('track', '6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6');
// 'spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6'
```

## Resource types

## Finding URIs and IDs

### From Spotify client

Right-click any item in Spotify and select "Share" → "Copy Spotify URI"

### From web URLs

Spotify web URLs contain IDs:

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    Track ID
```

Extract ID from URL:

```javascript
function getIdFromUrl(url) {
  const match = url.match(/\/(track|album|artist|playlist)\/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/);
  return match ? match[2] : null;
}
```

## Working with multiple IDs

Many endpoints accept multiple IDs:

```bash
# Get multiple tracks
GET /tracks?ids=6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6,1234567890abcdefghij,9876543210zyxwvutsrq

# Get multiple albums  
GET /albums?ids=id1,id2,id3
```

<Note>
Most endpoints accept up to 50 IDs per request.
