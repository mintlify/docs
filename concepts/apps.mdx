# Apps

Your Spotify application is registered in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). Each app receives credentials used for authentication.

## Creating an app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Developer Dashboard">
    Visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in with your Spotify account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new app">
    Click "Create app" and fill in the required information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings">
    Set up redirect URIs and other app settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your credentials">
    Note your Client ID and Client Secret for authentication.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## App settings

### Client ID and Client Secret

Your app receives two credentials:

- **Client ID**: Public identifier for your app
- **Client Secret**: Secret key that must be kept secure

<Warning>
Never expose your Client Secret in client-side code or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### Redirect URIs

Redirect URIs are the endpoints where users are redirected after authorization. You must register all redirect URIs your app will use.

Example redirect URIs:
- `http://localhost:3000/callback` (for local development)
- `https://myapp.com/callback` (for production)

Learn more about [redirect URIs](/concepts/redirect-uris).

## Development vs production

### Development mode

New apps start in development mode with:
- Access for up to 25 users
- Standard API rate limits
- Testing and development features

### Extended quota mode

For production apps serving more users:
- Request extended quota through the Dashboard
- Provide app details and use case
- Wait for Spotify approval

Learn more about [quota modes](/concepts/quota-modes).

## App dashboard

The Developer Dashboard provides:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Analytics" icon="chart-line">
    View API usage and user metrics
  </Card>
  <Card title="User management" icon="users">
    Add and manage test users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settings" icon="gear">
    Update app configuration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credentials" icon="key">
    Access client ID and secret
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store credentials in environment variables, not in code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Separate apps for environments">
    Create separate apps for development, staging, and production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate secrets periodically">
    Regenerate client secrets periodically for security.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage">
    Regularly check dashboard analytics for unusual activity.
