# Access tokens

Access tokens are credentials used to authenticate your requests to the Spotify Web API. Every API call must include a valid access token in the authorization header.

## What is an access token?

An access token is a string that represents the authorization granted to your application by a user or the Spotify authentication service. It allows your app to access Spotify resources on behalf of a user or access public data.

## Token format

Access tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that contain:

- User permissions (scopes)
- Expiration time
- Client information
- Signature for validation

<Warning>
Never share your access tokens publicly or commit them to version control. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Token lifetime

All access tokens expire after a short period (typically 1 hour). When a token expires, you need to:

- **With refresh token**: Request a new access token using your refresh token
- **Without refresh token**: Re-authenticate to get a new token

## Using access tokens

Include your access token in the `Authorization` header of every API request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

The format is always `Bearer` followed by a space and the token string.

### Example with JavaScript

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

### Example with Python

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/playlists',
    headers=headers
)

data = response.json()
```

## Obtaining access tokens

The method for obtaining an access token depends on your [authentication flow](/getting-started/authentication-flows):

  <Card title="Authorization Code with PKCE" href="/tutorials/authorization-code-pkce">
    For mobile, desktop, and SPAs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Client Credentials" href="/tutorials/client-credentials-flow">
    For server-to-server authentication
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Refresh tokens

Some authentication flows provide a refresh token along with the access token. Refresh tokens are long-lived credentials that can be used to obtain new access tokens without user interaction.

### Flows with refresh tokens

- Authorization Code Flow
- Authorization Code with PKCE Flow

### Flows without refresh tokens

- Client Credentials Flow (request a new token when expired)
- Implicit Grant Flow (deprecated)

Learn how to [refresh tokens](/tutorials/refreshing-tokens).

## Token scopes

Access tokens include information about the scopes (permissions) granted to your application. Scopes determine what resources and actions your app can access.

Example scopes:
- `user-read-private` - Read user's private information
- `playlist-modify-public` - Modify user's public playlists
- `user-modify-playback-state` - Control playback

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store tokens securely">
    Never store tokens in client-side code, localStorage, or cookies without proper encryption. Use secure server-side storage or encrypted databases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use HTTPS only">
    Always transmit tokens over HTTPS to prevent interception.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Implement token refresh">
    Automatically refresh expired tokens to maintain uninterrupted access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Revoke unused tokens">
    Allow users to revoke access and implement token cleanup for inactive users.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor token usage">
    Log and monitor token usage for unusual patterns that might indicate compromise.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Handling expired tokens

When a token expires, the API returns a 401 Unauthorized response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "status": 401,
    "message": "The access token expired"
  }
}
```

Your application should:

1. Detect the 401 error
2. Attempt to refresh the token (if refresh token is available)
3. Retry the original request with the new token
4. Prompt user to re-authenticate if refresh fails

Example error handling:

```javascript
async function makeRequest(url, token) {
  let response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });

  if (response.status === 401) {
    // Token expired, try to refresh
    const newToken = await refreshAccessToken();
    
    // Retry with new token
    response = await fetch(url, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${newToken}` }
    });
  }

  return response.json();
}
```
