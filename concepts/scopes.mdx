# Scopes

Authorization scopes define the level of access your application has to a user's Spotify data. When requesting authorization, you must specify which scopes your app needs.

## Available scopes

### Images

<ParamField scope="ugc-image-upload">
  Upload images to Spotify (for playlist covers)
</ParamField>

### Playlists

<ParamField scope="playlist-read-private">
  Read access to user's private playlists
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="playlist-read-collaborative">
  Read access to collaborative playlists
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="playlist-modify-public">
  Write access to user's public playlists
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="playlist-modify-private">
  Write access to user's private playlists
</ParamField>

### Playback

<ParamField scope="user-read-playback-state">
  Read access to playback state
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="user-modify-playback-state">
  Control playback (play, pause, skip, etc.)
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="user-read-currently-playing">
  Read currently playing track
</ParamField>

### Listening history

<ParamField scope="user-read-recently-played">
  Read recently played tracks
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="user-top-read">
  Read user's top artists and tracks
</ParamField>

</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="user-library-modify">
  Save and remove tracks, albums, and shows
</ParamField>

### Users

<ParamField scope="user-read-email">
  Read user's email address
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="user-read-private">
  Read user's subscription details (premium status)
</ParamField>

### Follow

<ParamField scope="user-follow-read">
  Read following state of artists and users
</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="user-follow-modify">

</ParamField>

### Streaming

<ParamField scope="streaming">

</ParamField>

<ParamField scope="app-remote-control">
  Control playback via app remote SDK
</ParamField>

## Requesting scopes

Specify scopes as a space-separated string in authorization requests:

```javascript
const scopes = [
  'user-read-private',
  'user-read-email',
  'playlist-read-private',
  'playlist-modify-public'
].join(' ');

const authUrl = `https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?` +
  `client_id=${clientId}&` +
  `response_type=code&` +
  `redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&` +
  `scope=${encodeURIComponent(scopes)}`;
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Request minimum scopes">
    Only request scopes your app actually needs. Users are more likely to approve minimal permissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Explain why you need access">
    Clearly communicate why your app needs specific permissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request additional scopes later">
    If you need more permissions later, request them only when needed rather than all upfront.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle denied scopes gracefully">
    Your app should handle cases where users deny specific permissions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Scope validation

After authorization, check which scopes were actually granted:

```javascript
const tokenResponse = await getAccessToken(code);
const grantedScopes = tokenResponse.scope.split(' ');

if (!grantedScopes.includes('playlist-modify-public')) {
  // User didn't grant playlist modification permission
  // Disable that feature or prompt again
}
```

<Note>
The access token includes information about granted scopes. Always validate you received the scopes you need.
