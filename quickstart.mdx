## Your documentation site

After onboarding, your documentation site deploys automatically to:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) Overview page.

## Setup

### Install the GitHub App

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub App** in your dashboard.
2. Click **Install GitHub App**.
3. Select your organization and repositories.

### Authorize GitHub

1. Go to **Settings** > **My Profile**.
2. Click **Authorize GitHub account**.

## Choose your workflow

### Code-based workflow

Install the CLI and work locally with your preferred tools.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

Create a new project:

```bash
mint new
```

Edit your documentation files. For example, open `index.mdx` and change the title:

```mdx index.mdx
---
title: "Hello World"
---
```

Preview locally:

```bash
mint dev
```

Push your changes to deploy automatically.

### Web editor workflow

Edit documentation in your browser with a visual interface.

1. Go to **Editor** in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select `index.mdx` and update the title to "Hello World".
3. Click **Publish** to deploy your changes.

## Add a custom domain

Go to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) and enter your domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`).

Add this DNS record with your domain provider:

| Record Type | Name | Value                | TTL  |
| ----------- | ---- | -------------------- | ---- |
| CNAME       | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v20.17.0 or higher installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
