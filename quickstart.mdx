Deploy your documentation site in minutes. Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach where every page has a corresponding file in your GitHub <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>.

## Deploy your site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding. You'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository, and install the GitHub App for automatic deployments.

Your site deploys to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip GitHub connection">
    Skip the GitHub connection during onboarding to start immediately. Mintlify creates a private repository for you that you can migrate later.
