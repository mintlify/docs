<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: [Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.
</Info>

## Getting started

After onboarding, your site deploys to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

### Install the GitHub App

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **GitHub App** in your dashboard.
2. Select **Install GitHub App** and choose your organization and repositories.

### Authorize your GitHub account

Navigate to **Settings** > **My Profile** and select **Authorize GitHub account**.

## Editing workflows

<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#code-based-workflow">
  Work locally with the CLI and Git.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#web-editor-workflow">
  Edit in your browser with a visual interface.
</Card>

## Code-based workflow

### Install the CLI

<Info>
  Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0+ (LTS preferred).
</Info>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

### Edit and preview

1. Run `mint new` to create a project, or clone your existing docs repo.
2. Edit your MDX files (e.g., change the title in `index.mdx`).
3. Run `mint dev` to preview at `localhost:3000`.
4. Push changes to deploy automatically.

## Web editor workflow

1. Open **Editor** in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select a file and make your edits.
3. Select **Publish** to deploy.

<Tip>
  Type <kbd>/</kbd> in the editor to access formatting tools. See the [web editor documentation](/editor) for more details.
</Tip>

## Adding a custom domain

While your `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` subdomain works well for testing and development, most teams prefer using a custom domain for production documentation.

To add a custom domain, navigate to the [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) page in your dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png"
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

Enter your domain (for example, `docs.yourcompany.com`) and follow the provided instructions to configure DNS settings with your domain provider.

<Table>
  | Record Type | Name                | Value                | TTL  |
  | ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
  | CNAME       | docs (or subdomain) | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though changes often complete much sooner.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v20.17.0 or higher installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
