3. Select your organization and repositories

Then authorize your account:

1. Go to **Settings** > **My Profile**
2. Click **Authorize GitHub account**

## Choose your workflow

Pick the editing workflow that works best for you:

<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#code-based-workflow">
  Edit locally with your preferred tools and Git
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#web-editor-workflow">
  Edit directly in your browser with a visual interface
</Card>

## Code-based workflow

Work locally with your preferred development tools.

### Install the CLI

<Info>
**Prerequisite**: Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v19 or higher.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create and edit

Run `mint new` to create a new project, then edit your MDX files. For example, open `index.mdx`:

```mdx index.mdx {2}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Preview locally

```bash
mint dev
```

Your preview runs at `localhost:3000`.

### Deploy

Push your changes to GitHub. Mintlify automatically builds and deploys your site.

## Web editor workflow

Edit your docs directly in the browser with a visual interface.

### Open the editor

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Click **Editor** in the sidebar

<Tip>
Type <kbd>/</kbd> to open the command menu and access formatting tools.
</Tip>

### Edit and publish

Select any file from the sidebar, make your changes, then click **Publish**. Your changes deploy immediately.

Learn more in the [web editor documentation](/editor).

## Add a custom domain

Go to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) and enter your domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`).

Add this DNS record with your domain provider:

| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |

<Info>
DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
