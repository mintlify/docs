After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update! 🎯

## Before you begin 📋

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>. 📂

When you connect your documentation repository to your Mintlify deployment, you can work on your documentation locally or in the web editor and sync any changes to your remote repository. 🔄

## Deploy your documentation site 🚀

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. During onboarding, you'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository for your documentation, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments. 🔗

After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL. 🌐

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding ⚡">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you. 🏃‍♂️

    This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later. 📝

## View your deployed site 👀

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. 🎉

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/). 📊
