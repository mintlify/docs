## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and and deploy them to the public.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview local changes">
1. Clone the repository you just made. 
2. Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally with this command:
  ```
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```
4. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where `mint.json` is):
  ```
  mintlify dev
  ```

</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Deploying changes to production">
Mintlify automatically deploys your docs when your push to Git through our Mintlify Github App. The link to install should have been sent to you after you deployed your docs. [Let us know](mailto:kate@mintlify.com) if you need a new link.

Once the bot has been successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash of the repo.
