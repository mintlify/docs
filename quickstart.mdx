Get your documentation site live in minutes. After completing this guide, you'll have a deployed site ready to customize.

<Info>
**Prerequisites**: [Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.
</Info>

## Your site is live

After onboarding, your documentation automatically deploys to:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

</Frame>

## Choose your editing workflow

<Card title="Web editor" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="/editor/getting-started">
  Edit directly in your browser with a visual interface
</Card>

<Card title="Local development" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#local-development">
  Work locally with your preferred tools and Git workflow
</Card>

## Local development

Install the CLI to work locally:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Preview your changes:

```bash
mint dev
```

Your preview will be available at `localhost:3000`. Push changes to your repository to deploy automatically.

## Adding a custom domain

While your `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` subdomain works well for testing and development, most teams prefer using a custom domain for production documentation.

To add a custom domain, navigate to the [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) page in your dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Enter your domain (for example, `docs.yourcompany.com`) and follow the provided instructions to configure DNS settings with your domain provider.

<Table>
| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs (or subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though changes often complete much sooner.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take upwards to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
