## Getting Started

Welcome! Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and
supercharge your documentation with Mintlify.

### Creating the Your Documentation Repository

Mintlify docs are rendered from MDX files and configurations defined in our
[starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter). We use GitHub to integrate
your docs with your code, and make source control effortless. Onboard through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) or get started by cloning our [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter).

Using basic Github commands will be very useful to getting your documentation up and running. For information on [creating a Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account), or [clonning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github), please refer to the following links.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install the GitHub app">
  
    Install our GitHub app to ensure that your updates are automatically deployed when you push changes. You can find the installation link in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app), on the Settings page. Upon successful installation, a check mark will appear next to the commit hash of the repository.

    </Frame>

  </Accordion>

<Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Monorepo Setup">
  If you want your docs to live alongside your larger codebase as a monorepo setup, you
  can: 1. Move your Mintlify docs code to your monorepo from your Mintlify Github Repo. 2. Specify the path to your
  `docs.json`, which was created from your Mintlify repo, into the
  [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings)

</Accordion>

### Updating the Content

Mintlify enables you to easily customize the style, structure, and content of
your docs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Editing locally (recommended for developers)">

    1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
    2. Once git is installed, clone your docs repository using `git clone <your-repo>`. If you haven't set it up yet, now would be a good time to do so with these [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    3. Use your favorite IDE to open the repository.
    4. Install our Mintlify CLI to preview changes with `npm i -g mintlify`.

    Learn more about this in our [local development guide](/development).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Editing with the web editor (recommended for non-developers)">

    Learn more about how to use the web editor on our [guide](/web-editor) to abstract away the pain of working with Github.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Customizing to your brand">
  
    Easily customize colors, logos and buttons among other configurations within our `docs.json` file within the Mintlify codebase. 

    When using our web editor, you should be able to search for our docs.json file using command + K.

    Start with these basic configurations:

    ```json
    "name": "Your Company"
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo/light.svg",
      "dark": "/logo/dark.svg",
      "href": "https://yourcompany.com"
    },
    "favicon": "/favicon.svg",
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#2AB673",
      "light": "#55D799",
      "dark": "#117866",
    },
    ```

    A full list of supported configurations can be found at [global settings](/settings/global).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Adding content">

    Add content by creating a new MDX file (.mdx). Copy and paste the content below to get started with a template:

    ```md
    ---
    title: "Page Title"
    sidebarTitle: "Sidebar title (optional - if different from page title)"
    description: "Subtitle (optional)"
    ---
    ```
    Learn more about adding images, tables, lists, and more using the [MDX syntax](/text). We also offer a [wide array of components](/content/components).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Pushing changes">

    Once ready, add, commit and push your changes to update your docs site. Here is a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) on how to do that. If the GitHub app is unable to successfully deploy your changes, you can manually update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Generating API references">

    You can easily set up your API references using an OpenAPI document.

    1. Add your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file into your docs repository or define the `openapi` field in `docs.json` with a URL.

    ```json
    "openapi": "link-to-your-openapi-file"
    ```

    2. Use our [scraper](/api-playground/openapi/setup#autogenerate-files-recommended) to autogenerate your OpenAPI endpoints files as:

    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
    ```

    3. Finally, include the generated endpoint MDX files to your `docs.json` under `navigation`.

    For a complete guide on using Mintlify with OpenAPI, check out [this guide](/api-playground/openapi/setup). [This guide](/api-playground/openapi/writing-openapi) explains how to configure your API authentication methods. For manual API references definition, explore [our syntax](/api-playground/overview).

  Within this section, I would focus on adding trouble shooting, this seems like the most technical part of this documentation, and because of that it would make most sense to expand on this section in particular. I think there also points where

  <Accordion icon="chart-simple" title="Adding analytics">

    Our in-house analytics give you insights into page views, search analytics, session recordings and more. Access these on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/analytics).

    We also support integrations with a range of analytics providers. You can find the list of providers [here](/integrations/analytics/overview).

### Publishing

<Accordion icon="star" title="Adding a custom domain">

Integrate your docs into your website by hosting them on a custom domain. This is included in the free plan.

Navigate to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) to add a custom domain.
