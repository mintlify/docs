[Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding to get started.

## Deploy your site

After onboarding, your documentation site deploys automatically to:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

## Set up GitHub

Install the GitHub App to automate deployments:

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub App** in your dashboard.
2. Select **Install GitHub App** and choose your repositories.
3. Go to **Settings** > **My Profile** and select **Authorize GitHub account**.

## Edit your documentation

Choose your preferred workflow:

### Web editor

1. Open the **Editor** in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select `index.mdx` in the file explorer.
3. Update the title field to "Hello World".
4. Select **Publish** to deploy your changes.

### Local development

Install the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create a project and start editing:

```bash
mint new
```

Preview locally:

```bash
mint dev
```

Push changes to your repository to deploy automatically.

## Add a custom domain

Go to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) and add your domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`).

Configure your DNS:

| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
