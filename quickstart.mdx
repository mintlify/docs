Get your documentation site live in minutes. This guide walks you through creating an account, deploying your first site, and making your first update.

## Create your account

[Sign up for Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/start) to get started. You can sign up with GitHub, GitLab, or email.

## Deploy your site

Once you create an account, Mintlify automatically deploys your documentation site to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Your site includes:
- A starter template with example pages
- Pre-configured navigation and settings
- A custom subdomain for your documentation

## Make your first update

You have two options for editing your documentation:

### Option 1: Use the visual editor

  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit a page">
    Select any page from the sidebar to start editing. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to add components like callouts, code blocks, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your changes">
    Click **Publish** to deploy your changes immediately to your live site.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Edit locally with the CLI

For more control and local development, use the CLI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Install the Mintlify CLI globally:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone your repository">
    Clone your documentation repository from GitHub or GitLab to your local machine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview locally">
    Navigate to your documentation directory and run:
    ```bash
    mint dev
    ```
    Your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make changes">
    Edit your MDX files in your preferred code editor. Changes appear in real-time in your local preview.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push to deploy">
    Commit and push your changes to your repository. Mintlify automatically deploys your updates.
