<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: [Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.
</Info>

## Your site is live

After onboarding, your documentation site is automatically deployed to:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

## Make your first edit

Choose your preferred workflow:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web editor">
    1. Open the [editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) in your dashboard
    2. Select `index.mdx` from the file explorer
    3. Update the title field to "Hello World"
    4. Select **Publish** to deploy your changes

    <Tip>
      Type <kbd>/</kbd> in the editor to access formatting tools and components.
    </Tip>

    See the [editor documentation](/editor) for more details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Local development">
    <Info>
      **Prerequisite**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher
    </Info>

    Install the CLI:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm i -g mint
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g mint
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Edit your documentation:

    1. Run `mint new` to create a new project
    2. Open `index.mdx` and update the title to "Hello World"
    3. Run `mint dev` to preview at `localhost:3000`
    4. Push changes to your repository to deploy

    See the [CLI installation guide](/installation) for more details.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add a custom domain (optional)

Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) in your dashboard and enter your domain (for example, `docs.yourcompany.com`).

Add this DNS record with your domain provider:

<Table>
  | Record Type | Name                | Value                | TTL  |
  | ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
  | CNAME       | docs (or subdomain) | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v20.17.0 or higher installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
