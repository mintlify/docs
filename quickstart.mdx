After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## Before you begin

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation where your documentation files live in your code <Tooltip headline="Repository" tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE." >repository</Tooltip>. You can use your own Git repository or a Mintlify-hosted repository.

Choose your repository approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Mintlify-hosted" icon="cloud">
    Mintlify creates a private GitHub repository connected to your Mintlify deployment.
    
    Choose this option if:
    - You will only work in the web editor and don't want to use Git locally.
    - You want to get started quickly without connecting a Git repository.
    
    You can always clone your repository to your own Git repository later.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Your own repository" icon="github">
    Connect your own Git repository to your Mintlify deployment.
    
    Choose this option if:
    - You have an existing repository you want to use for your documentation.
    - You want your documentation to be under your own GitHub organization.
    - You will work locally and want local changes to sync to your remote repository.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Not sure which to choose? Start with **Mintlify-hosted**. You can migrate to your own repository anytime if it better suits your needs.
</Tip>

## Deploy your documentation site

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mintlify-hosted">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create your account">
        Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and create your account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Skip GitHub connection">
        When prompted to connect GitHub, click **Skip** to use a Mintlify-hosted repository.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Complete onboarding">
        Follow the onboarding prompts to set up your documentation. Mintlify automatically creates a private repository in the `mintlify-community` organization for you and configures the GitHub app for you.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Your site is deployed">
        Your documentation is immediately deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Your own repository">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create your account">
        Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and create your account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect GitHub">
        When prompted, log in to your GitHub account and authenticate.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Complete onboarding">
        Follow the remaining onboarding prompts to create a repository and continue to your dashboard.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
        Install the Mintlify [GitHub App](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/api/github/install-app) to enable automatic deployments. This allows Mintlify to sync with your repository and deploy changes automatically when you push.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Optional: Select a repository">
        If you want to use a different repository than the one created during onboarding for your documentation, select it on the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard. Your documentation repository must have a valid `docs.json` file to deploy.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Your site is deployed">
        Your documentation is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL. Future changes pushed to your repository will automatically trigger new deployments.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Info>

## View your deployed site

Your documentation site is now deployed at:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png"
