After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## Before you begin

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored.">repository</Tooltip>.

When you connect your documentation repository to your Mintlify deployment, you can work on your documentation locally and sync any changes to your remote repository.

## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. During onboarding, you'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository for your documentation, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments.

After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## View your deployed site

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
</Tip>

## Make your first change

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher. Use an LTS version for stability.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm i -g mint
    ```

    
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -g mint
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    See [Install the CLI](/installation) for full details and troubleshooting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone your repository">
    If you haven't already cloned your repository locally, follow the instructions in [Clone your repository](/installation#clone-your-repository).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit a page">
    Open `index.mdx` in your preferred editor and update the description in the frontmatter:

    ```mdx
    ---
    title: "Introduction"
    description: "Your custom description here"
    ---
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview locally">
    Run the following command from your documentation directory:

    ```bash
    mint dev
    ```

    View your preview at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Push your changes">
    Commit and push your changes to trigger a deployment:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update description"
    git push
    ```

    Mintlify automatically deploys your changes. View your deployment status on the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page of your dashboard.
