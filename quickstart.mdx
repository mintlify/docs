## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to create your account and deploy your site. During onboarding, connect your GitHub account and select a repository for your documentation.

Your site deploys automatically to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

## Make your first change

Open the [web editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) in your dashboard. Edit `index.mdx` to update the description, then click **Publish**. Your changes deploy automatically.
