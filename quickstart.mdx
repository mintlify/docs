## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to deploy your site. Connect your GitHub account and select a repository for your documentation.

Your site deploys automatically at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

## Make your first change

Edit `index.mdx` in the [web editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) or locally with the [CLI](/installation):

```mdx
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "Your custom description here"
---
```

Push your changes to deploy automatically.
