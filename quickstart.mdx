## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to create your account and deploy your site. During onboarding, connect your GitHub account and select a repository for your documentation.

Your site deploys automatically to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

## Make your first change

Open the [web editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor), edit the **Introduction** page, and click **Publish**.
