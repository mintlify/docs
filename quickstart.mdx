## Deploy your site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to deploy your documentation. Connect your GitHub account and select a repository.

Your site is deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

## Make your first change

Edit `index.mdx` in the [web editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) or locally with the CLI:

```bash
npm i -g mint
mint dev
```

Publish from the web editor or push your changes to deploy automatically.
