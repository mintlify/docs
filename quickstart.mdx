Deploy a live documentation site in minutes.

## Before you begin

Choose your repository approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Mintlify-hosted" icon="cloud">
    Mintlify creates and manages a private GitHub repository for you. Best for getting started quickly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Your own repository" icon="github">
    Connect your own Git repository. Best for local development and existing repositories.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Deploy your documentation site

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mintlify-hosted">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create your account">
        Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and create your account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Skip GitHub connection">
        When prompted to connect GitHub, click **Skip** to use a Mintlify-hosted repository.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Complete onboarding">
        Follow the onboarding prompts to set up your documentation. Mintlify automatically creates a private repository in the `mintlify-community` organization and configures the GitHub app for you.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Your site is deployed">
        Your documentation is immediately deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Your own repository">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create your account">
        Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and create your account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect GitHub">
        When prompted, log in to your GitHub account and authenticate.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Complete onboarding">
        Follow the remaining onboarding prompts to create a repository and continue to your dashboard.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
        Install the Mintlify [GitHub App](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/api/github/install-app) to enable automatic deployments. This allows Mintlify to sync with your repository and deploy changes automatically when you push.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Optional: Select a repository">
        If you want to use a different repository than the one created during onboarding for your documentation, select it on the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard. Your documentation repository must have a valid `docs.json` file to deploy.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Your site is deployed">
        Your documentation is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL. Future changes pushed to your repository will automatically trigger new deployments.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
