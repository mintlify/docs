After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. During onboarding, you'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository for your documentation, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments.

After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Before sharing with users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
