Deploy a live documentation site in minutes.

## Before you begin

Choose between a Mintlify-hosted repository (quick start, web editor only) or your own Git repository (local development, full control).

## Deploy your site

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create account">
    Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect repository">
    Click **Skip** for Mintlify-hosted, or connect your GitHub account for your own repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete setup">
    Follow onboarding prompts. For your own repository, install the [GitHub App](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/api/github/install-app).
  </Step>

Your site deploys to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your URL on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) **Overview** page.
