Deploy a live documentation site and make your first change.

## Choose your repository

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation <Tooltip headline="Repository" tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>. You can use your own Git repository or a Mintlify-hosted repository.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Mintlify-hosted" icon="cloud">
    Mintlify creates a private GitHub repository connected to your deployment.
    
    **Choose this if:**
    - You only work in the web editor
    - You want to get started quickly
    - You want Mintlify to manage your repository
  </Card>

  <Card title="Your own repository" icon="github">
    Connect your own Git repository to your deployment.
    
    **Choose this if:**
    - You work locally and sync to your remote repository
    - You already have a documentation repository
    - You want documentation under your GitHub organization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Start with **Mintlify-hosted**. You can migrate to your own repository anytime.
