Your site deploys at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

## Make your first change

Edit `index.mdx` in the [web editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) or locally with the [CLI](/installation):

```mdx
