pnpm add -g mint
```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a project

Run `mint new` to create a new documentation project.

### Edit your docs

Open `index.mdx` and update the title:

```mdx index.mdx {2}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Preview locally

```bash
mint dev
```

Your preview is available at `localhost:3000`.

### Deploy

Push your changes to GitHub. Mintlify automatically builds and deploys your updates.

## Web editor workflow

### Access the editor

1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Editor** on the left sidebar.

### Edit your docs

Find `index.mdx` in the file explorer and update the title field to "Hello World".

<Tip>

</Tip>

### Publish

Select the **Publish** button in the top-right corner to deploy your changes.

## Add a custom domain

Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) in your dashboard and enter your domain (for example, `docs.yourcompany.com`).

Configure your DNS settings:

| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |

<Info>
DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
