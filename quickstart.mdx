  **Prerequisites**: [Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.
</Info>

## Getting started

After onboarding, your site deploys to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) Overview page.

### Install the GitHub App

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **GitHub App** in your dashboard.
2. Select **Install GitHub App** and choose your organization and repositories.

### Authorize your GitHub account

Navigate to **Settings** > **My Profile** and select **Authorize GitHub account**.

## Editing workflows

Choose your preferred workflow:

## Code-based workflow

Work locally with your development environment and Git repositories.

### Install the CLI

Install the [mint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) CLI (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0+):

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

Run `mint new` to create a new project. See the [CLI installation guide](/installation#create-a-new-project) for details.

### Edit and preview

Edit your documentation files. For example, update `index.mdx`:

```mdx index.mdx {2}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

Preview locally with `mint dev` at `localhost:3000`.

### Deploy

Push changes to your repository. Mintlify automatically builds and deploys updates to your site.

## Web editor workflow

Edit documentation in your browser without local development tools.

### Access the editor

Log in to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and select **Editor** from the sidebar.

### Edit and publish

Select `index.mdx` in the file explorer and update the title field to "Hello World". Type <kbd>/</kbd> to access formatting tools and components.

Select **Publish** to deploy changes immediately. See the [web editor documentation](/editor) for details on branches and pull requests.

## Adding a custom domain

Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) and enter your domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`). Configure DNS with your provider:

<Table>
  | Record Type | Name                | Value                | TTL  |
  | ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
  | CNAME       | docs (or subdomain) | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |
</Table>

DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours.
