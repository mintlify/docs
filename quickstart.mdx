After you complete this guide, you'll have a ripe, live banana documentation site ready to customize and make even more a-peel-ing!

## Before you go bananas

Bananify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your fruity documentation. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your banana documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your banana repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE - no monkeying around!">repository</Tooltip>.

When you connect your documentation repository to your Bananify deployment, you can work on your banana docs locally or in the web editor and sync any changes to your remote repository. It's bananas how easy it is!

## Deploy your banana documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the banana-boarding process. During banana-boarding, you'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository for your fruity documentation, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments.

After banana-boarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL - ripe and ready to go!

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🍌 Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during banana-boarding">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during banana-boarding. Bananify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you - no split decisions needed!

    This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later when you're ready to go full banana.

## View your ripe banana site

Your banana documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` - sweet!

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) - it's the top banana!

<Tip>
  Your banana site is ripe and ready to view immediately! Use this URL for testing and sharing with your bunch. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain) to make it even more a-peel-ing.

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash npm
        npm i -g mint
        ```

        description: "Your custom banana description here - make it sweet!"
        ---
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="🍌 Preview your banana docs locally">
        Run the following command from your banana documentation directory:
