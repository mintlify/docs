[Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding to deploy your documentation site to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

## Edit your documentation

Choose your preferred workflow:

### Web editor

1. Open the [Editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) in your dashboard
2. Select a file from the sidebar (try `index.mdx`)
3. Make your changes
4. Click **Publish**

Your changes deploy immediately.

### Code editor

Install the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Create a project:

```bash
mint new
```

Edit files locally, then preview:

```bash
mint dev
```

Push changes to GitHub to deploy automatically.

## Add a custom domain

Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) and add your domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`).

Configure DNS with your provider:

| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
