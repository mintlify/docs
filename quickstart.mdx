This quickstart guide will walk you through the process of setting up and deploying your documentation site in just a few minutes.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a live documentation site that's ready to customize and expand.

<Info>

**Prerequisites**: Before you begin, make sure to [create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.

</Info>

## Getting Started

Once you've completed the onboarding process, your documentation site will be automatically deployed to a unique URL with the following format.

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

You can find your URL from the Overview page of the dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png" alt="Mintlify Domain" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png" alt="Mintlify Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

This URL is instantly available and will update whenever you make changes to your documentation. It's perfect for testing and sharing with your team during development.

### Install the GitHub App

Mintlify provides a GitHub App that automates the deployment process when you push changes to your repository.

You can install the GitHub App by following the instructions from the onboarding checklist or from your dashboard.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **GitHub App** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Install GitHub App**. This will open a new tab to the GitHub App installation page.
4. Select the organization or user account where you want to install the app. Then select the repositories that you want to connect.

  <img src="/images/quickstart/github-app-installation-dark.png" alt="GitHub App Installation" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

<Info>
  Remember to update the GitHub App permissions if you move the documentation to a different repository.
</Info>

### Authorize your GitHub Account

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **My Profile** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Authorize GitHub account**. This will open a new tab to the GitHub authorization page.

<Info>
  You may need an admin for your GitHub organization to authorize your account depending on your organization's settings.
</Info>

## Editing Workflows

Mintlify offers two different workflows for creating and maintaining your documentation.

<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#code-based-workflow">
  For developers who prefer working with their existing tools. Click to jump to section.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#web-editor-workflow">
  For those who prefer a visual interface. Click to jump to section.
</Card>

## Code-Based Workflow

The code-based workflow integrates with your existing development environment and Git repositories, making it ideal for technical teams who want to manage documentation alongside their code.

### Install the CLI

To work locally with your documentation, install the Command Line Interface (CLI), called [mint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint), by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g mint
```


```bash yarn
yarn global add mint
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You need Node.js version 19 or higher installed on your machine. If you encounter installation issues, check the troubleshooting guide.
</Info>

### Edit the Documentation

Now that your environment is set up, you can start editing your documentation files. As an example, let's update the title of the introduction page:

Open your repository created during onboarding, find the `introduction.mdx` file, and find the top of the file, that should look like this:

```jsx introduction.mdx
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

Update the `title` field to `"Hello World"`.

```jsx introduction.mdx {2}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Preview the Changes

To preview the changes locally, run the following command.

```bash
mint dev
```

Your preview will be available at `localhost:3000`.

  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-dark.png" alt="Mintlify Dev" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Push the Changes

When you're ready to publish your changes, simply push the changes to your repository.

Mintlify will automatically detect the changes, build your documentation, and deploy the updates to your site. You can monitor the deployment status in your GitHub repository's commit history or the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

Once the deployment is complete, your last update will be available at `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

  Optionally skip the web editor workflow and jump to adding a custom domain.
</Card>

## Web Editor Workflow

The web editor workflow provides a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface for creating and editing documentation. It's ideal for people who want to work in their web browser without additional local development tools.

### Access the Web Editor

1. Log in to your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Editor** on the left sidebar.

<Info>
  If you haven't installed the GitHub App, you will be prompted to do so upon opening the web editor.
</Info>

  <img alt="The Mintlify web editor in the visual editor mode" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Edit the Documentation

In the web editor, you can navigate your documentation files in the sidebar. Let's update the introduction page.

Find and click on `introduction.mdx` in the file explorer.

Then, in the visual editor, update the title field to "Hello World".

<Frame>

  <img alt="Editing in Web Editor" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-editing-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  The editor provides a rich set of formatting tools and components. Access them by typing "/" in the editor to open the command menu.
</Tip>

### Publish Your Changes

When you're satisfied with your edits, click the `Publish` button in the top-right corner.

Your changes will be deployed immediately to your documentation site.

For more details about using the web editor, including advanced features like slash commands and image uploads, see our [Web Editor documentation](/editor).

## Adding a Custom Domain

While your `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` subdomain works well for testing and development, most teams prefer using a custom domain for production documentation.

To add a custom domain, go to `Settings` > `Custom Domain` from the dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Enter your domain (e.g., docs.yourcompany.com) and follow the provided instructions to configure DNS settings with your domain provider.

<Table>
| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs (or subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though they often complete much sooner.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, check our common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you're running the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take upwards to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
