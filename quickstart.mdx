## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
