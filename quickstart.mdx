This quickstart guide shows you how to set up and deploy your documentation site in minutes.

After you complete this guide, you will have a live documentation site ready to customize and expand.

<Info>

**Prerequisites**: Before you begin, [create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.

</Info>

## Getting Started

After you complete the onboarding process, your documentation site will automatically deploy to a unique URL with this format:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png" alt="Mintlify Domain" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png" alt="Mintlify Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

This URL becomes available immediately and updates when you make changes to your documentation. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team during development.

### Install the GitHub App

Mintlify provides a GitHub App that automates deployment when you push changes to your repository.

Install the GitHub App by following the instructions from the onboarding checklist or from your dashboard.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **GitHub App** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Install GitHub App**. This opens a new tab to the GitHub App installation page.
4. Select the organization or user account where you want to install the app. Then select the repositories that you want to connect.

  <img src="/images/quickstart/github-app-installation-dark.png" alt="GitHub App Installation" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

<Info>
  Update the GitHub App permissions if you move your documentation to a different repository.
</Info>

### Authorize your GitHub Account

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **My Profile** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Authorize GitHub account**. This opens a new tab to the GitHub authorization page.

<Info>
  An admin for your GitHub organization may need to authorize your account depending on your organization settings.
</Info>

## Editing Workflows

Mintlify offers two workflows for creating and maintaining your documentation.

<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#code-based-workflow">
  For users who prefer working with existing tools in their local environment. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#web-editor-workflow">
  For users who prefer a visual interface in their web browser. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

## Code-Based Workflow

The code-based workflow integrates with your existing development environment and Git repositories. This workflow is best for technical teams who want to manage documentation alongside code.

### Install the CLI

To work locally with your documentation, install the Command Line Interface (CLI), called [mint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint), by running this command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g mint
```


```bash yarn
yarn global add mint
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You need Node.js version 19 or higher installed on your machine. If you encounter installation issues, check the troubleshooting guide.
</Info>

### Edit the Documentation

After you set up your environment, you can start editing your documentation files. For example, update the title of the introduction page:

Open your repository created during onboarding, find the `introduction.mdx` file, and find the top of the file:

```jsx introduction.mdx
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

Update the `title` field to `"Hello World"`.

```jsx introduction.mdx {2}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Preview the Changes

To preview the changes locally, run this command:

```bash
mint dev
```

Your preview will be available at `localhost:3000`.

  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-dark.png" alt="Mintlify Dev" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Push the Changes

When you are ready to publish your changes, push the changes to your repository.

Mintlify automatically detects the changes, builds your documentation, and deploys the updates to your site. Monitor the deployment status in your GitHub repository commit history or the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

After the deployment is complete, your latest update will be available at `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

<Card title="Jump to adding a custom domain" icon="arrow-down" href="#adding-a-custom-domain" horizontal>
  Optionally, skip the web editor workflow and jump to adding a custom domain.
</Card>

## Web Editor Workflow

The web editor workflow provides a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface for creating and editing documentation. This workflow is best for people who want to work in their web browser without additional local development tools.

### Access the Web Editor

1. Log in to your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Editor** on the left sidebar.

<Info>
  If you have not installed the GitHub App, you will be prompted to install the app when you open the web editor.
</Info>

  <img alt="The Mintlify web editor in the visual editor mode" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Edit the Documentation

In the web editor, you can navigate through your documentation files in the sidebar. Let's update the introduction page:

Find and click on `introduction.mdx` in the file explorer.

Then, in the visual editor, update the title field to "Hello World".

<Frame>

  <img alt="Editing in Web Editor" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-editing-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  The editor provides a rich set of formatting tools and components. Type <kbd>/</kbd> in the editor to open the command menu and access these tools.
</Tip>

### Publish Your Changes

When you are satisfied with your edits, click the `Publish` button in the top-right corner.

Your changes are immediately deployed to your documentation site.

For more details about using the web editor, including advanced features like slash commands and image uploads, see our [Web Editor documentation](/editor).

## Adding a Custom Domain

While your `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` subdomain works well for testing and development, most teams prefer using a custom domain for production documentation.

To add a custom domain, go to `Settings` > `Custom Domain` from the dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Enter your domain (for example, `docs.yourcompany.com`) and follow the provided instructions to configure DNS (Domain Name System) settings with your domain provider.

<Table>
| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs (or subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though changes often complete much sooner.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take upwards to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
