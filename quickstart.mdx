Mintlify employs a docs-as-code approach where each page corresponds to a file in your <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>. Connect your repository to work locally or through the web editor, syncing changes seamlessly.

## Deploy your site

Visit [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to connect your GitHub account and select a repository. The onboarding process installs the GitHub App and deploys your site to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

  <Accordion title="Skip GitHub connection">
