Get your documentation site live in minutes. This guide walks you through deploying your site and making your first update.

## What you'll accomplish

- Deploy a live documentation site
- Connect your GitHub repository
- Make and publish your first change
- Preview changes locally or in the web editor

## How Mintlify works

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach. Every page on your site corresponds to a file in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>. When you push changes to your repository, Mintlify automatically deploys them to your live site.

You can edit documentation in two ways:
- **Locally** - Clone your repository and use your preferred IDE
- **Web editor** - Edit directly in your browser with live preview

## Step 1: Deploy your site

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start onboarding">
    Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to begin the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect GitHub">
    Connect your GitHub account and either:
    - Create a new repository for your documentation
    - Select an existing repository

    The GitHub App installation enables automatic deployments when you push changes.

    <Tip>
      Want to try Mintlify first? Skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository for you, and you can migrate to your own repository later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete setup">
    Finish the onboarding flow. Your documentation site deploys automatically and becomes accessible at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: View your live site

Your documentation is now live. Find your site URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="block dark:hidden"

  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Your `.mintlify.app` URL is perfect for testing and team collaboration. When you're ready to share with users, add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
</Note>

## Step 3: Make your first change

Choose your preferred editing method:

  <Tab title="CLI (local editing)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the CLI">
        Install the Mintlify CLI to preview changes locally. Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher.

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash npm
        npm i -g mint
        ```

        ```bash pnpm
        pnpm add -g mint
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        <Accordion title="Troubleshooting installation">
          See [Install the CLI](/installation) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting steps.
        </Accordion>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Clone your repository">
        Clone your documentation repository to your local machine:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-docs-repo.git
        cd your-docs-repo
        ```

        See [Clone your repository](/installation#clone-your-repository) for detailed instructions.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Edit a page">
        Open `index.mdx` in your preferred editor and make a change. For example, update the description:

        ```mdx
        ---
        title: "Introduction"
        description: "Welcome to our documentation"
        ---
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Preview locally">
        Start the local development server:

        ```bash
        mint dev
        ```

        Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see your changes in real-time.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Deploy your changes">
        When you're satisfied with your changes, commit and push to deploy:

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Update introduction description"
        git push
        ```

        Mintlify automatically builds and deploys your changes. Track deployment progress on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

  <Tab title="Web editor (browser-based)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the web editor">
        Go to the [web editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) in your dashboard. The editor loads your documentation files directly in your browser.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Edit a page">
        Select `index.mdx` from the file tree and make a change. For example, update the description:

        ```mdx
        ---
        title: "Introduction"
        description: "Welcome to our documentation"
        ---
        ```

        The preview pane updates automatically as you type.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Publish your changes">
        Click **Publish** in the top-right corner. Add a commit message describing your changes, then confirm.
      </Step>
      <Step title="View your live site">
        Your changes deploy automatically. Check deployment status on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/). Once complete, refresh your documentation site to see the updates.
