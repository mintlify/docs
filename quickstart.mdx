Get your documentation site up and running in minutes.

## Before you begin

Mintlify manages your documentation as code. Each page corresponds to a file in your GitHub repository, which you can edit using our web editor or locally with your preferred IDE.

## Deploy your documentation site

1. Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create or select a repository for your documentation
4. Install the Mintlify GitHub App

Your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

## View your deployed site

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

    className="hidden dark:block"
  />

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
