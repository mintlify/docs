Get your documentation site live on the web in under 5 minutes. This guide walks you through creating, customizing, and deploying your first Mintlify site.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this quickstart, you will:

- Deploy a live documentation site to the web
- Customize your site's branding and navigation
- Make and preview changes to your documentation
- Understand the basic structure of a Mintlify project

## Before you begin

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach. Every page on your site is a file in your GitHub repository. You can edit these files in the web editor or locally with Git.

## Deploy your documentation site

<Note>**Time estimate:** 2-3 minutes</Note>

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. During onboarding, you'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository for your documentation, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments.

After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you.

    This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## View your deployed site

<Note>**Time estimate:** 1 minute</Note>

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
</Tip>

**Verify your deployment:**

<Check>Your site loads at the `.mintlify.app` URL</Check>
<Check>The default template content is visible</Check>
<Check>Navigation sidebar appears on the left</Check>

## Make your first change

<Note>**Time estimate:** 2-5 minutes (depending on method)</Note>

Choose your preferred editing method:

- **Web editor** - Edit in your browser with instant preview (recommended for quick changes)
- **CLI** - Edit locally with your preferred IDE and full Git workflow (recommended for developers)

        <Warning>
          **Common issues:**
          - If you get a permissions error, try using `sudo` (macOS/Linux) or run your terminal as administrator (Windows)
          - If Node.js version is too old, update to the latest LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en)
        </Warning>

        <Warning>
          **Common issue:** If you get a "repository not found" error, verify that the GitHub App has access to your repository in your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/installations).
        </Warning>
