After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## Before you begin

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation. This means:

- Every page on your site has a corresponding MDX file stored in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>
- Your documentation structure is defined in a `docs.json` configuration file
- Changes are tracked with version control through Git
- Updates are automatically deployed when you push to your repository

When you connect your documentation repository to your Mintlify deployment, you can work on your documentation locally in your preferred IDE or use the web editor in your browser. All changes sync to your remote repository and trigger automatic deployments.

This approach gives you the flexibility to edit documentation however you prefer while maintaining a single source of truth in your repository.

## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. The onboarding wizard guides you through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your GitHub account">
    Sign in with GitHub to authorize Mintlify to access your repositories. This connection allows Mintlify to read your documentation files and deploy updates automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a repository">
    You have two options:
    
    - **Create a new repository**: Mintlify generates a starter template with example pages and configuration
    - **Use an existing repository**: Connect a repository that already contains documentation files
    
    If you're starting fresh, creating a new repository is the fastest way to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
    The Mintlify GitHub App enables automatic deployments. When you push changes to your repository, Mintlify automatically builds and deploys your documentation site.
    
    You can install the app on all repositories or select specific ones. You can always modify these permissions later in your GitHub settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your site">
    Choose your project name, which determines your initial `.mintlify.app` URL. You can add a custom domain later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you.

    This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later. See [Migrate to your own repository](/editor/migrate-repository) for instructions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## View your deployed site

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
</Tip>

## Understand your documentation structure

Your documentation repository contains several key files and folders:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="docs.json">
    The main configuration file that defines your site's navigation, branding, and settings. This file controls:
    
    - Navigation structure (pages, groups, tabs)
    - Site metadata (name, logo, colors)
    - Feature settings (search, analytics, feedback)
    
    See [Settings](/settings) for all available configuration options.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MDX files">
    Your documentation pages are written in MDX, which combines Markdown with React components. Each `.mdx` file includes:
    
    - **Frontmatter**: Metadata like title and description at the top of the file
    - **Content**: Your documentation text using Markdown syntax
    - **Components**: Interactive elements like tabs, accordions, and code blocks
    
    See [Writing content](/writing-content/overview) to learn about MDX syntax and available components.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="mint.json (legacy)">
    If you see a `mint.json` file instead of `docs.json`, your site uses the legacy configuration format. Both files work the same way, but `docs.json` is the current standard.
    
    You can continue using `mint.json` or rename it to `docs.json` at any time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="images folder">
    Store images and other static assets in an `images` folder (or any folder name you prefer). Reference images in your MDX files using relative paths:
    
    ```mdx
    ![Alt text](/images/example.png)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Make your first change

You can edit your documentation using the CLI for local development or the web editor for browser-based editing. Both methods sync changes to your repository and trigger automatic deployments.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    The CLI provides a local development environment where you can preview changes instantly before deploying. This workflow is ideal for developers who prefer working in their IDE.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the CLI">
        The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher. Use an LTS version for stability.

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash npm
        npm i -g mint
        ```

        
        ```bash pnpm
        pnpm add -g mint
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        See [Install the CLI](/installation) for full details and troubleshooting.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Clone your repository">
        Clone your documentation repository to your local machine:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-docs-repo.git
        cd your-docs-repo
        ```

        If you need help finding your repository URL, see [Clone your repository](/installation#clone-your-repository).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Edit a page">
        Open `index.mdx` in your preferred editor and update the description in the frontmatter:

        ```mdx
        ---
        title: "Introduction"
        description: "Your custom description here"
        ---
        ```

        The frontmatter section at the top of each MDX file contains metadata like the page title and description. This metadata appears in search results and navigation.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Preview locally">
        Run the development server from your documentation directory:

        ```bash
        mint dev
        ```

        View your preview at `http://localhost:3000`. The preview updates automatically as you edit files, so you can see changes in real-time without reloading.

        <Tip>
          The local preview matches your production site exactly, including navigation, styling, and components. Use it to verify changes before deploying.
        </Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Push your changes">
        Commit and push your changes to trigger a deployment:

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Update description"
        git push
        ```

        Mintlify automatically deploys your changes when you push to your repository. View your deployment status on the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page of your dashboard. Deployments typically complete in under a minute.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Web editor">
    The web editor provides a browser-based editing experience with a live preview. This workflow is ideal for quick updates and non-technical team members.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the web editor">
        Navigate to the [web editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) in your dashboard. The editor loads your documentation files directly from your repository.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Edit a page">
        Select the **Introduction** page from the file tree on the left, then update the description in the editor.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/quickstart/hello-world-light.png" alt="Introduction page open in the web editor with the description edited to say Hello world!." 
          className="block dark:hidden"
          />
          <img src="/images/quickstart/hello-world-dark.png" alt="Introduction page open in the web editor with the description edited to say Hello world!." 
          className="hidden dark:block"
          />
        </Frame>

        The preview pane on the right updates automatically as you type, showing exactly how your changes will appear on your live site.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Publish">
        Click the **Publish** button in the top-right of the web editor toolbar. This commits your changes to your repository and triggers a deployment.

        You can add a commit message to describe your changes, which helps track updates in your repository history.
      </Step>
      <Step title="View live">
        On the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page of your dashboard, you can see your site's deployment status. When it finishes deploying (typically under a minute), refresh your documentation site to see your changes live.
