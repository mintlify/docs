## Hark! A Prologue to Thy Documentation Journey

*When thou hast read this verse complete,*
*A living site shall be thy feat,*
*Ready to mold and customize,*
*Beneath the vast and starry skies.*

## Ere Thou Begin'st This Noble Quest

Fair Mintlify doth embrace the way
Of docs-as-code, both night and day.
Each page that graces thy fair site
Hath correspondence, stored in <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository's</Tooltip> light.

When thou dost bind thy repository
To Mintlify's deployment, verily,
Thou may'st work local or in editor's grace,
And sync thy changes to the remote place.

## The Summoning of Thy Documentation Realm

Venture forth to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) with haste,
And let the onboarding flow be traced.
Connect thy GitHub with solemn vow,
Create or choose repository now,
Install the GitHub App with care,
That automatic deployments fill the air.

When onboarding's task is truly done,
Thy documentation site's begun!
Accessible at `.mintlify.app` 'twill be,
A domain of knowledge, wild and free.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    *Should haste compel thee, noble friend,*
    *And patience reach its bitter end,*
    Skip GitHub's bond in onboarding's phase—
    Mintlify shall guide thee through the maze.
    A private repository it creates,
    Within organization's private gates,
    The GitHub App configured complete,
    That thou may'st start thy editing feat.

    Thus may'st thou use the editor straight,
    And to thine own repository migrate.

## Behold Thy Deployed Estate

Lo! Thy documentation site now stands
At `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`, as planned!

Upon the **Overview** page, thy [dashboard's](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) shrine.
