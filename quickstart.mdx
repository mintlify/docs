<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: [Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.
</Info>

## Getting started

After onboarding, your documentation site automatically deploys to:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

### Connect GitHub

Install the GitHub App to automate deployments:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **GitHub App** in your dashboard.
2. Select **Install GitHub App** and choose your organization.
3. Select the repositories to connect.
4. Go to **Settings** → **My Profile** and select **Authorize GitHub account**.

## Make your first edit

Choose your preferred workflow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Code-based" icon="terminal" href="/installation">
    Install the CLI and edit locally with your favorite tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web editor" icon="mouse-pointer-2" href="/editor">
    Edit directly in your browser with a visual interface.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Quick example

Edit `index.mdx` to change your homepage title:

```mdx index.mdx {2}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

**Code-based**: Run `mint dev` to preview at `localhost:3000`, then push to deploy.

**Web editor**: Open the [editor](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor), make changes, and select **Publish**.

## Add a custom domain (optional)

Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) and enter your domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`). Add this DNS record:

| Record Type | Name                | Value                | TTL  |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
| CNAME       | docs (or subdomain) | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v20.17.0 or higher installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
