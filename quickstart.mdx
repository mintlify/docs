After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## Before you begin

You'll need a GitHub account to deploy your documentation site. Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach where every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>.

Your documentation repository connects to your Mintlify deployment, allowing you to work locally or in the web editor and sync changes automatically.

## Deploy your documentation site

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start onboarding">
    Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to begin the onboarding process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect GitHub">
    Connect your GitHub account and create or select a repository for your documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install GitHub App">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub App to enable automatic deployments when you push changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After completing onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<Tip>
  Want to get started quickly? You can skip connecting your own repository during onboarding. Mintlify will create a private repository for you, letting you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later.
</Tip>

## View your deployed site

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
