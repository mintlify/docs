This comprehensive guide walks you through setting up a complete documentation site, from initial deployment to your first customizations. After completing this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and scale for your team.

<Card title="What you'll accomplish" icon="check-circle" horizontal>
  Deploy a live documentation site, make your first edits, and learn both web editor and CLI workflows.
</Card>

## Before you begin

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Before starting, ensure you have:
    - A GitHub account
    - Basic familiarity with Markdown (helpful but not required)
    - For CLI usage: Node.js v20.17.0 or higher installed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understanding the docs-as-code approach">
    Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>.

    When you connect your documentation repository to your Mintlify deployment, you can work on your documentation locally or in the web editor and sync any changes to your remote repository.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy your documentation site

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the onboarding process">
    Navigate to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and click **Get started** to begin the onboarding process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your GitHub account">
    During onboarding, you'll be prompted to:
    - Connect your GitHub account
    - Create a new repository or select an existing one for your documentation
    - Install the Mintlify GitHub App to enable automatic deployments

    <Tip>
      The GitHub App allows Mintlify to automatically deploy changes whenever you push updates to your repository.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your setup approach">
    You have two options for getting started:

    **Option 1: Connect your own repository** (Recommended for production)
    - Full control over your documentation repository
    - Easy integration with existing development workflows
    - Seamless collaboration with your team

    **Option 2: Use Mintlify's managed repository**
    - Skip GitHub connection during onboarding for faster setup
    - Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization
    - Perfect for testing and quick prototyping
    - Can migrate to your own repository later
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete deployment">
    After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your custom `.mintlify.app` URL within 2-3 minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens during deployment?">
    When you complete onboarding, Mintlify automatically:
    - Creates your documentation repository with starter content
    - Sets up continuous deployment from your GitHub repository  
    - Generates your unique `.mintlify.app` subdomain
    - Configures SSL certificates for secure access
    - Optimizes your site for performance and SEO
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repository structure explained">
    Your new documentation repository includes:
    - `docs.json` - Configuration file for site settings, navigation, and themes
