Get your documentation site live in minutes. This guide covers deploying your site and making your first edit.

## Before you begin

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach where each page on your site corresponds to a file in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where files and their history are stored">repository</Tooltip>.

You can edit your documentation files using the web editor or work locally with your preferred IDE. Changes sync automatically to your live site.

## Deploy your documentation site

1. Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create or select a repository for your documentation
4. Install the Mintlify GitHub App for automatic deployments

Your site deploys automatically and becomes accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you.

    This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later.

## View your deployed site

Your site is live at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
