<Info>This guide takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.</Info>

After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) (GitLab and Bitbucket are also supported)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher (only required for CLI usage)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (only required for local development)

## How Mintlify works

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>.

When you connect your documentation repository to your Mintlify deployment, you can work on your documentation locally or in the web editor and sync any changes to your remote repository.

## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. During onboarding, you'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository for your documentation, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments.

After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you.

    This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## View your deployed site

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).
</Tip>

<Check>
  **Success!** If you see your documentation site with the default Mintlify template, your deployment is working correctly. You're ready to make your first change.

## Make your first change

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the CLI">
        The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher. Use an LTS version for stability.

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash npm
        npm i -g mint
        ```

        
        ```bash pnpm
        pnpm add -g mint
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        See [Install the CLI](/installation) for full details and troubleshooting.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Clone your repository">
        If you haven't already cloned your repository locally, follow the instructions in [Clone your repository](/installation#clone-your-repository).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Edit a page">
        Open `index.mdx` in your preferred editor and update the description in the frontmatter:

        ```mdx
        ---
        title: "Introduction"
        description: "Your custom description here"
        ---
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Preview locally">
        Run the following command from your documentation directory:

        ```bash
        mint dev
        ```

        View your preview at `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Push your changes">
        Commit and push your changes to trigger a deployment:

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Update description"
        git push
        ```

        Mintlify automatically deploys your changes. View your deployment status on the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page of your dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GitHub App installation failed">
    Make sure you have admin permissions on the repository you're trying to connect. If you're part of an organization, you may need an organization admin to approve the GitHub App installation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Node.js version error when installing CLI">
    Mintlify CLI requires Node.js v20.17.0 or higher. Check your version with `node --version` and update if needed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deployment not updating after push">
    Deployments typically complete within 1-2 minutes. Check the deployment status on your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/). If the deployment shows an error, review the build logs for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not loading">
    Ensure you're running `mint dev` from the root of your documentation directory (where `docs.json` is located). If the port is in use, try `mint dev --port 3001`.
  </Accordion>
