After completing this guide, you will have a production-ready documentation site with advanced configuration, automated workflows, and best practices for team collaboration.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: Before you begin, [create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding. You should also have Git installed and basic familiarity with version control concepts.
</Info>

<Warning>
  This guide covers advanced setup including CI/CD integration, environment configuration, and team workflows. For a simpler introduction, see our [basic setup guide](/index).
</Warning>

## Initial deployment and environment setup

After you complete the onboarding process, your documentation site automatically deploys to a unique URL with this format:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png"
    alt="Mintlify Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Mintlify Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

Your site's URL is available immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team while you are setting up your docs site.

### Configure environment-specific settings

For production deployments, configure environment-specific variables in your `docs.json`:

```json docs.json
{
  "name": "Your Documentation",
  "logo": {
    "light": "/logo/light.svg",
    "dark": "/logo/dark.svg"
  },
  "favicon": "/favicon.png",
  "analytics": {
    "ga4": {
      "measurementId": "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
    },
    "posthog": {
      "apiKey": "phc_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  },
  "api": {
    "baseUrl": ["https://api.production.com", "https://api.staging.com"],
    "auth": {
      "method": "bearer"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Use different analytics IDs and API endpoints for staging and production environments to maintain clean data separation.
</Tip>

### Install and configure the GitHub App

Mintlify provides a GitHub App that automates deployment when you push changes to your repository. For production environments, configure the app with appropriate permissions and branch protection rules.

Install the GitHub App by following the instructions from the onboarding checklist or your dashboard.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **GitHub App** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Install GitHub App**. This opens a new tab to the GitHub App installation page.
4. Select the organization or user account where you want to install the app.
5. Select the repositories that you want to connect.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/github-app-installation-light.png"
    alt="GitHub App Installation"
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/github-app-installation-dark.png"
    alt="GitHub App Installation"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Info>
  Update the GitHub App permissions if you move your documentation to a different repository.
</Info>

#### Configure branch protection rules

For production deployments, set up branch protection rules in your GitHub repository:

1. Navigate to your repository **Settings** > **Branches**.
2. Add a branch protection rule for your main branch.
3. Enable the following settings:
   - **Require pull request reviews before merging** (at least 1 approval)
   - **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - **Include administrators** (optional but recommended)

<CodeGroup>

```yaml .github/workflows/mintlify-check.yml
name: Mintlify Documentation Check

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - '**.mdx'
      - 'docs.json'
      - 'mint.json'

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          
      - name: Install Mintlify CLI
        run: npm install -g mint
        
      - name: Check documentation build
        run: mint build --check
```

```yaml .github/CODEOWNERS
# Documentation team owns all MDX files
*.mdx @your-org/docs-team

# Configuration files require admin approval
docs.json @your-org/admin-team
mint.json @your-org/admin-team
```

</CodeGroup>

This ensures all documentation changes are reviewed before deployment and automated checks validate your documentation builds successfully.

### Authorize your GitHub account

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **My Profile** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Authorize GitHub account**. This opens a new tab to the GitHub authorization page.

<Info>
  An admin for your GitHub organization may need to authorize your account depending on your organization settings.
</Info>

## Editing workflows

Mintlify offers two workflows for creating and maintaining your documentation:

<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#code-based-workflow">
  For users who prefer working with existing tools in their local environment. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#web-editor-workflow">
  For users who prefer a visual interface in their web browser. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

## Code-based workflow

The code-based workflow integrates with your existing development environment and Git repositories. This workflow is best for technical teams who want to manage documentation alongside code.

### Install the CLI

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher through v24. LTS versions are preferred.
</Info>

To work locally with your documentation, install the Command Line Interface (CLI), called [mint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint), by running this command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

### Create a new project with advanced configuration

Run `mint new` to create a new documentation project with a comprehensive starter template:

```bash
mint new --template advanced
```

This creates a project structure optimized for larger documentation sites:

```
docs/
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/
│   │   ├── mintlify-check.yml
│   │   └── deploy-preview.yml
│   └── CODEOWNERS
├── api-reference/
│   ├── introduction.mdx
│   └── openapi.json
├── guides/
│   ├── getting-started.mdx
│   └── advanced-topics.mdx
├── components/
│   └── custom-components.tsx
├── snippets/
│   ├── prerequisites.mdx
│   └── common-errors.mdx
├── images/
├── docs.json
├── mint.json
└── .mintignore
```

<Accordion title="Understanding the advanced project structure">
  - **`.github/workflows/`**: CI/CD automation for documentation checks and preview deployments
  - **`api-reference/`**: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications and API documentation
  - **`guides/`**: Long-form documentation organized by topic
  - **`components/`**: Custom React components for enhanced interactivity
  - **`snippets/`**: Reusable content blocks to maintain consistency
  - **`.mintignore`**: Files and directories to exclude from builds
</Accordion>

See the [CLI installation guide](/installation#create-a-new-project) for details on additional command flags and options.

### Edit the documentation with advanced features

After setting up your project, you can leverage advanced MDX features and custom components. Let's create a comprehensive getting started guide:

1. Navigate to your documentation repository.
2. Create or open `guides/getting-started.mdx`:

```mdx guides/getting-started.mdx
---
title: "Getting started"
description: "Complete guide to integrating our platform with your application"
icon: "rocket"
sidebarTitle: "Quick start"
mode: "wide"
---

import Prerequisites from '/snippets/prerequisites.mdx';

<Prerequisites />

## Installation

Install our SDK using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @yourcompany/sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @yourcompany/sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @yourcompany/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

Configure the SDK with your API credentials:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { Client } from '@yourcompany/sdk';

    const client = new Client({
      apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
      environment: 'production',
      timeout: 30000,
      retryConfig: {
        maxRetries: 3,
        backoffMultiplier: 2
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from yourcompany import Client

    client = Client(
        api_key=os.environ.get("API_KEY"),
        environment="production",
        timeout=30,
        retry_config={
            "max_retries": 3,
            "backoff_multiplier": 2
        }
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys directly to your repository. Use environment variables or a secrets management service.
</Warning>

## Making your first request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the client">
    Create a client instance with your configuration:
    
    ```typescript
    const client = new Client({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Authenticate your requests using the configured API key:
    
    ```typescript
    await client.authenticate();
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make a request">
    Execute your first API call:
    
    ```typescript
    const response = await client.users.list({
      limit: 10,
      offset: 0
    });
    
    console.log(response.data);
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Error handling

Implement comprehensive error handling for production applications:

```typescript
try {
  const response = await client.users.get(userId);
  return response.data;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof APIError) {
    switch (error.statusCode) {
      case 401:
        console.error('Authentication failed:', error.message);
        break;
      case 404:
        console.error('User not found:', error.message);
        break;
      case 429:
        console.error('Rate limit exceeded:', error.message);
        // Implement exponential backoff
        break;
      default:
        console.error('API error:', error.message);
    }
  }
  throw error;
}
```

<Accordion title="Common error codes and solutions">
  - **401 Unauthorized**: Check your API key is valid and has not expired
  - **403 Forbidden**: Verify your API key has the required permissions
  - **404 Not Found**: Confirm the resource ID exists
  - **429 Too Many Requests**: Implement rate limiting and exponential backoff
  - **500 Internal Server Error**: Retry the request with exponential backoff
</Accordion>

    alt="Mintlify Dev"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

#### Advanced development options

Configure your local development environment with additional flags:

```bash
# Specify a custom port
mint dev --port 3001

# Enable verbose logging for debugging
mint dev --verbose

# Watch specific directories only
mint dev --watch guides,api-reference

# Disable hot reload for performance testing
mint dev --no-hot-reload
```

<Accordion title="Setting up a development environment with Docker">
  For teams that prefer containerized development:

  ```dockerfile Dockerfile.dev
  FROM node:20-alpine

  WORKDIR /docs

  # Install Mintlify CLI
  RUN npm install -g mint

  # Copy documentation files
  COPY . .

  EXPOSE 3000

  CMD ["mint", "dev", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
  ```

  ```yaml docker-compose.yml
  version: '3.8'
  services:
    docs:
      build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      ports:
        - "3000:3000"
      volumes:
        - .:/docs
        - /docs/node_modules
      environment:
        - NODE_ENV=development
  ```

  Run with: `docker-compose up`
</Accordion>

### Push the changes

When you are ready to publish your changes, push them to your repository.

Mintlify automatically detects the changes, builds your documentation, and deploys the updates to your site. Monitor the deployment status in your GitHub repository commit history or the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

After the deployment completes, your latest update will be available at `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

<Card title="Jump to adding a custom domain" icon="arrow-down" horizontal href="#adding-a-custom-domain">
  Optionally, skip the web editor workflow and jump to adding a custom domain.
</Card>

## Web editor workflow

The web editor workflow provides a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface for creating and editing documentation. This workflow is best for people who want to work in their web browser without additional local development tools.

### Access the web editor

1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Editor** on the left sidebar.

<Info>
  If you have not installed the GitHub App, you will be prompted to install the app when you open the web editor.
</Info>

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="The Mintlify web editor in the visual editor mode"

  <img
    alt="The Mintlify web editor in the visual editor mode"
    src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-dark.png"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Edit the documentation

In the web editor, you can navigate through your documentation files in the sidebar. Let's update the introduction page:

Find and select `index.mdx` in the file explorer.

Then, in the editor, update the title field to "Hello World".

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Editing in Web Editor"
    src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-editing-light.png"
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    alt="Editing in Web Editor"
    src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-editing-dark.png"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  The editor provides a rich set of formatting tools and components. Type <kbd>/</kbd>

   in the editor to open the command menu and access these tools.
</Tip>

### Publish your changes

When you're satisfied with your edits, select the **Publish** button in the top-right corner. Your changes are immediately deployed to your documentation site.

<Tip>
  Use branches to preview and review changes through pull requests before deploying to your live site.
</Tip>

For more details about using the web editor, including using branches and pull requests to collaborate and preview changes, see our [web editor documentation](/editor).

## Adding a custom domain

While your `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` subdomain works well for testing and development, most teams prefer using a custom domain for production documentation.

To add a custom domain, navigate to the [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) page in your dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png"
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

Enter your domain (for example, `docs.yourcompany.com`) and follow the provided instructions to configure DNS settings with your domain provider.

<Table>
  | Record Type | Name                | Value                | TTL  |
  | ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
  | CNAME       | docs (or subdomain) | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though changes often complete much sooner.
</Info>
