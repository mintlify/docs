This guide walks you through deploying your first documentation site and making your first change. You'll have a live site in minutes.

## How it works

Mintlify connects to a GitHub repository where your documentation files are stored. Every page on your site corresponds to a file in your <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>.

You can edit your documentation using either:
- **Web editor**: Edit directly in your browser
- **Local environment**: Use your preferred code editor and push changes via Git

## Deploy your site

1. Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create a new repository or select an existing one
4. Install the Mintlify GitHub App to enable automatic deployments

Your site deploys immediately and is accessible at your unique `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify creates a private repository in a private organization and automatically configures the GitHub App for you.

    This lets you use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later.

## Find your site URL

Find your site URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/). Your URL follows the format `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

<Tip>
  Your site is live and ready to share with your team. Add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain) before sharing with users.
