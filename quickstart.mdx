## Before you begin

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach. Every page has a corresponding file in your documentation <Tooltip tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>.

Connect your repository to work locally or in the web editor and sync changes to your remote repository.

## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding. You'll connect your GitHub account, select a repository, and install the GitHub App for automatic deployments.

Your site deploys to your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optional: Skip connecting GitHub during onboarding">
    Skip the GitHub connection to get started quickly. Mintlify creates a private repository and configures the GitHub App automatically.

    Use the web editor immediately and migrate to your own repository later.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## View your deployed site

Your site is at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>

    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="block dark:hidden"

    src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png"
    alt="Overview page of the Mintlify dashboard."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Use this URL for testing and team sharing. Add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain) before sharing with users.
