Get a live documentation site up and running in minutes.

## Deploy your site

1. Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start)
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create a new repository or select an existing one
4. Complete the onboarding process

Your documentation site is automatically deployed to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

<Tip>
  Want to start without connecting GitHub? You can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify will create a private repository for you, and you can migrate to your own repository later.
</Tip>

## Find your site URL

View your live site URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).
