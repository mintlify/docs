<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: [Create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.
</Info>

## Getting started

After onboarding, your site deploys to `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`. Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

### Install the GitHub App

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **GitHub App** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Install GitHub App** and choose your organization and repositories.

### Authorize your GitHub account

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **My Profile**.
2. Select **Authorize GitHub account**.

## Edit your documentation

Choose your preferred workflow:

### Code-based workflow

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher.
</Info>

1. Install the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Run `mint new` to create a project.
3. Edit files (e.g., update `title` in `index.mdx`).
4. Preview with `mint dev` at `localhost:3000`.
5. Push changes to deploy automatically.

### Web editor workflow

1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Editor** in the sidebar.
3. Edit files and select **Publish** to deploy.

## Add a custom domain

Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) and enter your domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`). Configure DNS with your provider:

<Table>
  | Record Type | Name                | Value                | TTL  |
  | ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
  | CNAME       | docs (or subdomain) | cname.vercel-dns.com | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup process, check these common troubleshooting solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local preview not working">
    Make sure you have Node.js v20.17.0 or higher installed and that you run the `mint dev` command from the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting on live site">
    Deployment can take up to a few minutes. Check your GitHub Actions (for code-based workflow) or deployment logs in the Mintlify dashboard to ensure there are no build errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    Verify that your DNS records are set up correctly and allow sufficient time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours). You can use tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record.
