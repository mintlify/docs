After you complete this guide, you'll have a live documentation site ready to customize and update.

## Before you begin

Mintlify uses a docs-as-code approach to manage your documentation. Every page on your site has a corresponding file stored in your documentation <Tooltip headline="Repository" tip="Your documentation's source code where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your documentation repository to access and modify content, or you can edit files locally in your preferred IDE.">repository</Tooltip>.

You'll connect your own GitHub repository to your Mintlify deployment. This allows you to work locally, sync to your remote repository, and keep your documentation under your own GitHub organization.

## Deploy your documentation site

Go to [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete the onboarding process. During onboarding, you'll connect your GitHub account, create or select a repository, and install the GitHub App to enable automatic deployments.

After onboarding, your documentation site is deployed and accessible at your `.mintlify.app` URL.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Skip connecting GitHub for now">
    If you want to get started quickly without connecting your own repository, you can skip the GitHub connection during onboarding. Mintlify will create a private repository in the `mintlify-community` organization and automatically configure the GitHub App for you.

    This is a temporary option that allows you to use the web editor immediately. You can migrate to your own repository later if needed.

    To skip: When prompted to connect GitHub during onboarding, click **Skip**.

</AccordionGroup>

## View your deployed site

Your documentation site is now deployed at `https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

Find your exact URL on the **Overview** page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Your site is ready to view immediately. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team. Before sharing with your users, you may want to add a [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain).

## Make your first change

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    <Note>
      The GitHub App must be installed to enable automatic deployments when you push changes. If you completed onboarding, the app is already installed. See [GitHub](/deploy/github) for details.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install the CLI">
        The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher. Use an LTS version for stability.

        ```bash npm
        npm i -g mint
        ```

        ```bash pnpm
        pnpm add -g mint
        ```

        description: "Your custom description here"
        ---
        ```

      <Step title="Preview locally">
        Run the following command from your documentation directory:

        ```bash

        View your preview at `http://localhost:3000`.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Push your changes">
        Commit and push your changes to trigger a deployment:
