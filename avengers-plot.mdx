The Avengers (2012) follows Earth's mightiest heroes as they unite to stop a global threat.

## The threat emerges

Loki, the Asgardian god of mischief and Thor's adoptive brother, arrives on Earth through a portal created by the Tesseract (the Space Stone). He steals the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and uses his scepter to mind-control Hawkeye and Dr. Erik Selvig.

## Assembling the team

Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., activates the Avengers Initiative. He recruits:

- **Tony Stark / Iron Man** - Genius billionaire in powered armor
- **Steve Rogers / Captain America** - Super-soldier from World War II
- **Thor** - Asgardian god of thunder, Loki's brother
- **Bruce Banner / Hulk** - Scientist who transforms when angry
- **Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow** - Master spy and assassin
- **Clint Barton / Hawkeye** - Expert archer (initially under Loki's control)

## Internal conflict

The team struggles to work together. Loki manipulates them, and tensions rise aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Banner transforms into the Hulk during an attack, and Loki escapes after apparently killing Agent Coulson.

## The battle of New York

Loki opens a portal above Stark Tower in Manhattan, allowing the Chitauri alien army to invade Earth. The Avengers finally unite:

1. Iron Man and Thor battle Chitauri in the skies
2. Captain America coordinates ground defense
3. Black Widow works to close the portal
4. Hawkeye provides tactical support from a rooftop
5. Hulk smashes through enemy forces

## The climax

The World Security Council launches a nuclear missile at Manhattan. Iron Man intercepts it and flies it through the portal into space, destroying the Chitauri command ship. Black Widow closes the portal using Loki's scepter. Tony falls back through just before it closes and is caught by the Hulk.

## Resolution

The Avengers capture Loki. Thor returns to Asgard with Loki and the Tesseract. The team disperses but has proven they can work together when Earth needs them.
