## Overview

The Avengers (2012) is a superhero film that brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to face a global threat.

## Plot summary

### The Tesseract threat

Loki, the Asgardian god of mischief, arrives on Earth through a portal opened by the Tesseract, a powerful energy source being studied by S.H.I.E.L.D. He steals the Tesseract and mind-controls several agents, including Hawkeye, planning to use it to open a portal for an alien army to invade Earth.

### Assembling the team

Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., activates the Avengers Initiative. He recruits:

- **Tony Stark / Iron Man** - Genius billionaire in a powered suit
- **Steve Rogers / Captain America** - Super soldier from World War II
- **Bruce Banner / Hulk** - Scientist who transforms when angry
- **Thor** - Asgardian god and Loki's brother
- **Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow** - Skilled spy and combatant
- **Clint Barton / Hawkeye** - Expert archer (initially under Loki's control)

### Conflict and unity

The heroes initially struggle to work together due to clashing personalities and Loki's manipulation. After Loki is captured and brought aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, his allies attack, causing the Hulk to rampage and seemingly killing Agent Phil Coulson.

Coulson's death motivates the team to set aside their differences and unite against the common threat.

### The Battle of New York

Loki opens a portal above Stark Tower in New York City, unleashing the Chitauri alien army. The Avengers assemble to defend the city:

- Iron Man and Captain America coordinate the defense
- Thor battles Loki and attacks the portal
- Hulk smashes through alien forces and defeats Loki
- Black Widow finds a way to close the portal
- Hawkeye provides aerial support from a rooftop

When the World Security Council launches a nuclear missile at Manhattan, Iron Man intercepts it and carries it through the portal into space, destroying the Chitauri command ship. The portal closes just as Stark falls back through, and he is caught by the Hulk.

### Resolution

With the battle won, Loki is captured and Thor takes him back to Asgard along with the Tesseract. The Avengers go their separate ways, but remain ready to reassemble when the world needs them again.
