## Headers

Headers organize your content and create navigation anchors. They appear in the table of contents and help users scan your documentation.

### Creating headers

Use `#` symbols to create headers of different levels:

```mdx
## Main section header
### Subsection header
#### Sub-subsection header
```

<Tip>
  Use descriptive, keyword-rich headers that clearly indicate the content that follows. This improves both user navigation and search engine optimization.
</Tip>

## Text formatting

We support most Markdown formatting for emphasizing and styling text.

### Basic formatting

Apply these formatting styles to your text:

| Style | Syntax | Example | Result |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Bold** | `**text**` | `**important note**` | **important note** |
| *Italic* | `_text_` | `_emphasis_` | *emphasis* |
| ~~Strikethrough~~ | `~text~` | `~deprecated feature~` | ~~deprecated feature~~ |

### Combining formats

You can combine formatting styles:

```mdx
**_bold and italic_**
**~~bold and strikethrough~~**
*~~italic and strikethrough~~**
```

**_bold and italic_**<br />
**~~bold and strikethrough~~**<br />
*~~italic and strikethrough~~*

### Superscript and subscript

For mathematical expressions or footnotes, use HTML tags:

| Type | Syntax | Example | Result |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Superscript | `<sup>text</sup>` | `example<sup>2</sup>` | example<sup>2</sup> |
| Subscript | `<sub>text</sub>` | `example<sub>n</sub>` | example<sub>n</sub> |

## Links

Links help users navigate between pages and access external resources. Use descriptive link text to improve accessibility and user experience.

### Internal links

Link to other pages in your documentation using root-relative paths:

```mdx
[Quickstart](/quickstart)
[Steps](/components/steps)
```

[Quickstart](/quickstart)<br />
[Steps](/components/steps)

<Note>
  Avoid relative links like `[page](../page)` as they load slower and cannot be optimized as effectively as root-relative links.
</Note>

### External links

For external resources, include the full URL:

```mdx
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
```

[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

### Broken links

You can check for broken links in your documentation using the [CLI](/installation):

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes highlight important information, quotes, or examples within your content.

### Single line blockquotes

Add `>` before text to create a blockquote:

```mdx
> This is a quote that stands out from the main content.
```

> This is a quote that stands out from the main content.

### Multi-line blockquotes

For longer quotes or multiple paragraphs:

```mdx
> This is the first paragraph of a multi-line blockquote.
>
> This is the second paragraph, separated by an empty line with `>`.
```

> This is the first paragraph of a multi-line blockquote.
>
> This is the second paragraph, separated by an empty line with `>`.

<Tip>
  Use blockquotes sparingly to maintain their visual impact and meaning. Consider using [callouts](/components/callouts) for notes, warnings, and other information.
</Tip>

## Mathematical expressions

We support LaTeX for rendering mathematical expressions and equations.

### Inline math

Use single dollar signs, `$`, for inline mathematical expressions:

```mdx
The Pythagorean theorem states that $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$ in a right triangle.
```

The Pythagorean theorem states that $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$ in a right triangle.

### Block equations

Use double dollar signs, `$$`, for standalone equations:

```mdx
$$
E = mc^2
$$
```

$$
E = mc^2
$$

<Info>
  LaTeX support requires proper mathematical syntax. Refer to the [LaTeX documentation](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/) for comprehensive syntax guidelines.

## Line breaks and spacing

Control spacing and line breaks to improve content readability.

### Paragraph breaks

Separate paragraphs with blank lines:

```mdx
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph, separated by a blank line.
```

This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph, separated by a blank line.

### Manual line breaks

Use HTML `<br />` tags for forced line breaks within paragraphs:

```mdx
This line ends here.<br />
This line starts on a new line.
```

This line ends here.<br />
This line starts on a new line.

<Tip>
  In most cases, paragraph breaks with blank lines provide better readability than manual line breaks.
</Tip>

## Best practices

### Content organization
- Use headers to create clear content hierarchy
- Follow proper header hierarchy (don't skip from H2 to H4)
- Write descriptive, keyword-rich header text

### Text formatting
- Use bold for emphasis, not for entire paragraphs
- Reserve italics for terms, titles, or subtle emphasis
- Avoid over-formatting that distracts from content

### Links
- Write descriptive link text instead of "click here" or "read more"
- Use root-relative paths for internal links
- Test links regularly to prevent broken references
