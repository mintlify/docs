title: ".mintignore"
description: "Exclude files and folders from your documentation build"
---

Use `.mintignore` to exclude specific files and folders from your documentation build. This file works exactly like `.gitignore`, allowing you to define patterns for content that should not be processed or deployed.

## Creating a `.mintignore` file

Create a `.mintignore` file in the root of your documentation directory. The file uses the same syntax and pattern matching as `.gitignore`.

```text .mintignore
# Ignore draft content
drafts/

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
*.bak

# Ignore specific files
internal-notes.mdx
team-only.mdx

# Ignore all files in a directory except one
secret/*
!secret/public-info.mdx
```

## Pattern syntax

`.mintignore` supports standard gitignore pattern matching:

- `*` matches any string of characters except `/`
- `**` matches any string of characters including `/`
- `?` matches any single character except `/`
- `[abc]` matches any character inside the brackets
- Lines starting with `#` are comments
- Lines starting with `!` negate previous patterns

## Common use cases

### Ignore draft content

Exclude work-in-progress documentation from your build:

```text
drafts/
wip/
*.draft.mdx
```

### Ignore internal documentation

Keep internal notes and team-specific content out of your public docs:

```text
internal/
team-notes/
*-internal.mdx
```

### Ignore temporary files

Exclude backup files and editor artifacts:

```text
*.tmp
*.bak
*.swp
*~
.DS_Store
```

### Ignore test files

Exclude test content used during development:

```text
test/
*.test.mdx
examples/sandbox/
```

## How it works

When you build your documentation, Mintlify reads the `.mintignore` file and excludes any matching files and folders from processing. Ignored files:

- Are not processed during the build
- Do not appear in your deployed documentation
- Are not indexed for search
- Are not available to the AI assistant

<Note>
  Files excluded by `.mintignore` are completely removed from the build. If you want to keep files accessible by URL but hidden from navigation, use [hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages) instead.
</Note>

## Differences from hidden pages

`.mintignore` and [hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages) serve different purposes:

| Feature | `.mintignore` | Hidden pages |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Included in build | No | Yes |
| Accessible by URL | No | Yes |
| Indexed for search | No | Optional |
| Available to AI assistant | No | Optional |
| Use case | Exclude from deployment | Hide from navigation |

## Examples

### Basic example

```text .mintignore
# Ignore all draft content
drafts/

# Ignore specific files
internal-roadmap.mdx
team-meeting-notes.mdx
```

### Advanced example

```text .mintignore
# Ignore all markdown files in the temp directory
temp/**/*.mdx

# Ignore all files starting with underscore
_*

# But don't ignore _meta.json files
!_meta.json

# Ignore backup files
*.bak
*.tmp

# Ignore OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore editor files
*.swp
*.swo
*~
```

### Monorepo example

For monorepo setups, place `.mintignore` in your documentation directory:

```text
/your-monorepo
  |- packages/
  |- apps/
  |- docs/
    |- .mintignore
    |- docs.json
    |- index.mdx
```

The patterns in `.mintignore` are relative to the documentation directory, not the repository root.
