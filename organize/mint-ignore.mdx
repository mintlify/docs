The `.mintignore` file allows you to exclude specific files and directories from being processed and published to your documentation site.

Use `.mintignore` to keep drafts, internal notes, and source files out of your public documentation while maintaining them in your repository.

## Creating a .mintignore file

Create a `.mintignore` file in the root of your docs directory. This file uses the same pattern syntax as `.gitignore`, making it familiar and easy to configure.

```plaintext .mintignore
# Exclude draft documents
drafts/
*.draft.mdx

# Exclude internal documentation
internal/

# Exclude specific files
private-notes.md
```

When Mintlify builds your documentation, it reads the `.mintignore` file and excludes any matching files or directories from processing. Excluded files:

- Won't appear in your published documentation
- Won't be indexed for search
- Won't be accessible to visitors

<Note>
  Unlike [hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages), files excluded by `.mintignore`
  are completely removed from your site and cannot be accessed by URL.
</Note>

## Pattern syntax

The `.mintignore` file follows `.gitignore` syntax. Here are common patterns:

| Pattern            | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `drafts/`          | Excludes the entire `drafts` directory         |
| `*.draft.mdx`      | Excludes all files ending in `.draft.mdx`      |
| `private-notes.md` | Excludes a specific file                       |
| `**/internal/**`   | Excludes any `internal` directory at any level |
| `!important.mdx`   | Negates a previous pattern (includes the file) |
