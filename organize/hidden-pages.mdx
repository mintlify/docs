Hidden pages don't appear in your site's navigation, but anyone who knows the URL can still access them. For example, if you create a hidden page like `guides/hidden-page.mdx`, visitors can reach it at `docs.yoursite.com/guides/hidden-page`.

Use hidden pages for content you want users to access or reference as context for AI tools, but don't want listed in the navigation.

If your content requires strict access control, you must configure [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup).

To restrict pages to specific user groups, set up [group-based access control](/deploy/authentication-setup#control-access-with-groups).

See an [example of a hidden page](/organize/hidden-page-example).

<Note>
  Some navigation elements like sidebars, dropdowns, and tabs may appear empty or shift layout on hidden pages.

## Hide a page

To hide a page, set `hidden: true` in the page's [frontmatter](/organize/pages) or remove it from your `docs.json` navigation.

### Set `hidden: true` in frontmatter

Add `hidden: true` to a page's frontmatter to remove it from the rendered navigation while still including it in your `docs.json` configuration.

```yaml
---
title: "My hidden page"
hidden: true
---
```

<Note>
  **Hidden pages are automatically noindexed.** When you set `hidden: true`, the page is automatically excluded from search engine indexing, sitemaps, and AI context (llms.txt). However, the reverse is not true: setting `noindex: true` does **not** hide a page from navigation. See [Disable indexing](/optimize/seo#disable-indexing) for more information.
</Note>

### Remove the page from navigation

If you don't include a page in your `docs.json` navigation, you hide it. This method works well for pages that you don't want to appear in navigation at all.

## Hide a group of pages

To hide a group of pages, set the `hidden` property to `true` for the group in your `docs.json` file:

```json highlight={4}
"groups": [
  {
    "group": "Getting started",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  },
  {
    "group": "Guides",
    "pages": [
      "guides/hidden-page.mdx",
      "guides/hidden-groups.mdx"
    ]
  }
]
```
In this example, the `Getting started` group is hidden and the `Guides` group is visible.

### Hide a tab

To hide a tab, add the `hidden` property for the tab in your `docs.json` file:

```json highlight={4}
"tabs": [
  {
    "tab": "Home",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Search, SEO, and AI indexing

By default, hidden pages don't appear in indexing for search engines, documentation site search, or as AI assistant context. To include hidden pages in search results and assistant context, add the `seo` property to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "indexing": "all"
}
```

### Understanding hidden vs. noindex

The relationship between `hidden` and `noindex` is one-directional:

- **`hidden: true` → automatically applies `noindex`**: Hidden pages are automatically excluded from search engines, sitemaps, and AI context.
- **`noindex: true` → does NOT apply `hidden`**: Pages with `noindex: true` remain visible in navigation. They only affect search engine indexing and AI context.

To exclude a specific page from search engines while keeping it visible in navigation, add `noindex: true` to its frontmatter. To hide a page from navigation and search engines, use `hidden: true`.
