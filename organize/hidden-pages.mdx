Hidden pages do not display in your site's navigation but remain publicly accessible to anyone who knows their URL. For example, a hidden page like `guides/hidden-page.mdx` is accessible at `docs.yoursite.com/guides/hidden-page`.

Use hidden pages for content that you want to be accessible on your site or referenced as context for AI tools, but not discoverable through the navigation.

For content requiring strict access control, you must configure [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup).

To restrict pages to specific groups of users, configure [group-based access control](/deploy/authentication-setup#control-access-with-groups).

See an [example of a hidden page](/organize/hidden-page-example).

<Note>
  Some navigation elements like sidebars, dropdowns, and tabs may appear empty or shift layout on hidden pages.

## Hide a page

You can hide a page by setting `hidden: true` in the page's [frontmatter](/organize/pages) or by removing it from your `docs.json` navigation.

### Set `hidden: true` in frontmatter

Add `hidden: true` to a page's frontmatter to remove it from the rendered navigation while keeping it in your `docs.json` configuration.

```yaml
---
title: "My hidden page"
hidden: true
---
```

Search engines cannot index pages with `hidden: true`. See [Disable indexing](/optimize/seo#disabling-indexing) for more information.

### Remove the page from navigation

Any page not included in your `docs.json` navigation is hidden. This is useful for pages that you don't want in your navigation configuration at all.

## Hide a group of pages

A group of pages is hidden if the `hidden` property is set to `true` in your `docs.json` file:

```json highlight={4}
"groups": [
  {
    "group": "Getting started",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  },
  {
    "group": "Guides",
    "pages": [
      "guides/hidden-page.mdx",
      "guides/hidden-groups.mdx"
    ]
  }
]
```
In this example, the `Getting started` group is hidden, but the `Guides` group is visible.

### Hiding a tab

You can also hide a tab by adding the `hidden` property to your `docs.json` file:

```json highlight={4}
"tabs": [
  {
    "tab": "Home",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Search, SEO, and AI indexing

By default, hidden pages are excluded from indexing for search engines, internal search within your docs, and as context for the AI assistant. To include hidden pages in search results and as context for the assistant, add the `seo` property to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "indexing": "all"
}
```

To exclude a specific page, add `noindex: true` to its frontmatter.
