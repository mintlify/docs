Control which UI elements appear in your documentation by hiding navigation items, API sections, and other components. This guide covers all the ways you can control visibility in your Mintlify documentation.

## Hide navigation elements

Use the `hidden` property to remove navigation elements from view while keeping them in your configuration. Hidden elements don't appear in the navigation but remain accessible if users know the URL.

### Hide pages

Hide individual pages by setting `hidden: true` in the page's frontmatter or by removing the page from your `docs.json` navigation.

#### Set `hidden: true` in frontmatter

Add `hidden: true` to a page's frontmatter to remove it from the rendered navigation while still including it in your `docs.json` configuration.

```yaml
---
title: "My hidden page"
hidden: true
---
```

<Note>
  Search engines cannot index pages with `hidden: true`. See [Disable indexing](/optimize/seo#disable-indexing) for more information.
</Note>

#### Remove from navigation

If you don't include a page in your `docs.json` navigation, you hide it. This method works well for pages that you don't want to appear in navigation at all.

### Hide groups

Hide an entire group of pages by setting the `hidden` property to `true` for the group in your `docs.json` file:

```json
"groups": [
  {
    "group": "Getting started",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Hide tabs

Hide a tab by adding the `hidden` property for the tab in your `docs.json` file:

```json
"tabs": [
  {
    "tab": "Home",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Hide anchors

Hide an anchor by adding the `hidden` property:

```json
"anchors": [
  {
    "anchor": "Documentation",
    "icon": "book-open",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "quickstart",
      "development"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Hide dropdowns

Hide a dropdown by adding the `hidden` property:

```json
"dropdowns": [
  {
    "dropdown": "Documentation",
    "icon": "book-open",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "quickstart",
      "development"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Hide API documentation sections

Control which parts of your API documentation appear to users. You can hide specific sections or entire endpoints.

### Hide specific endpoints

Use the `x-hidden` property in your OpenAPI specification to exclude specific endpoints from your generated API documentation:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/internal-endpoint": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Internal endpoint",
        "x-hidden": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For more information, see [Managing page visibility](/api-playground/managing-page-visibility#x-hidden).

### Hide API sections with CSS

Use custom CSS to hide specific API sections like authorization headers or other auto-generated content. Add a `style.css` file to your repository:

```css
/* Hide API authorization section */
.api-section[data-section="authorization"] {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide specific API section headings */
.api-section-heading[data-heading="Authorizations"] {
  display: none;
}
```

For available selectors, see the [Custom scripts](/customize/custom-scripts#using-identifiers-and-selectors) documentation.

## Hide the sidebar

Control sidebar visibility on specific pages or across your entire site.

### Hide sidebar on specific pages

Use the `mode` frontmatter property to control page layout and sidebar visibility:

```yaml
---
title: "Landing page"
mode: "custom"
---
```

Available layout modes:

- `wide`: Hides table of contents to allow wider layouts
- `center`: Hides sidebar and table of contents for better readability
- `custom`: Minimal layout with only the top navbar

### Hide sidebar with CSS

Use custom CSS to hide the sidebar globally or on specific pages:

```css
/* Hide sidebar globally */
#sidebar {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Hide sidebar on specific pages */
[data-page="landing"] #sidebar {
  display: none !important;
}
```

## Hide the Mintlify badge

The "Powered by Mintlify" badge appears on documentation sites by default. To remove this badge, you need to be on a paid plan.

<Note>
  Badge removal is available on paid plans. Contact [sales@mintlify.com](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) to upgrade your plan and remove the badge.
</Note>

Once you're on a paid plan, the badge is automatically removed from your documentation site.

## Hide other UI components

Use custom CSS to hide additional UI elements throughout your documentation.

### Hide the table of contents

```css
#table-of-contents {
  display: none;
}
```

### Hide the feedback toolbar

```css
#feedback-toolbar {
  display: none;
}
```

### Hide the search bar

```css
#search-bar-entry {
  display: none;
}

#search-bar-entry-mobile {
  display: none;
}
```

### Hide navigation items

```css
/* Hide specific navigation items */
.navigation-items [data-page="specific-page"] {
  display: none;
}
```

## Search and SEO considerations

By default, hidden pages don't appear in indexing for search engines, documentation site search, or as AI assistant context.

### Include hidden pages in search

To include hidden pages in search results and assistant context, add the `seo` property to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
  "indexing": "all"
}
```

### Exclude specific pages from search

To exclude a specific page from search indexing, add `noindex: true` to its frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Hidden page"
noindex: true
---
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use hidden pages for internal documentation">
    Hidden pages work well for internal documentation, draft content, or pages you want to share via direct link without cluttering your navigation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consider authentication for sensitive content">
    If your content requires strict access control, use [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup) instead of hiding pages. Hidden pages are still accessible to anyone who knows the URL.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test custom CSS carefully">
    When using custom CSS to hide elements, test across different themes and screen sizes. UI element references may change as the platform evolves.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document your hidden elements">
    Keep track of which elements you've hidden and why. This helps maintain your documentation as your team grows.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
