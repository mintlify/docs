Control which UI elements appear in your documentation. Hide navigation elements, API sections, sidebars, and other components to create a cleaner, more focused user experience.

## Hiding navigation elements

Use the `hidden` property to remove navigation elements from view while keeping them in your configuration.

### Hide pages

Hide individual pages from navigation by setting `hidden: true` in the page's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Internal documentation"
hidden: true
---
```

Hidden pages remain accessible via direct URL but don't appear in navigation, search results, or sitemaps. See [Hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages) for more details.

### Hide groups

Hide entire groups of pages by setting the `hidden` property in your `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Internal docs",
        "hidden": true,
        "pages": ["internal/page1", "internal/page2"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hide tabs

Hide tabs from the top navigation bar:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Beta features",
        "hidden": true,
        "pages": ["beta/feature1", "beta/feature2"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hide anchors

Hide anchors from the sidebar:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "anchors": [
      {
        "anchor": "Legacy docs",
        "hidden": true,
        "pages": ["legacy/overview"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hide dropdowns

Hide dropdown menus:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "dropdowns": [
      {
        "dropdown": "Archive",
        "hidden": true,
        "pages": ["archive/old-content"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hiding API documentation sections

Control visibility of API playground and documentation elements.

### Hide the API playground

Hide the interactive API playground globally by setting `display` to `none` in your `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "playground": {
      "display": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

Options for `display`:
- `interactive` - Show the full interactive playground (default)
- `simple` - Show a copyable endpoint without the playground
- `none` - Hide the playground entirely

### Hide playground on specific pages

Override the global playground setting for individual API pages using frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Create user"
api: "POST /users"
playground: "none"
---
```

### Hide playground for unauthenticated users

Show the playground only to authenticated users:

```yaml
---
title: "Create user"
api: "POST /users"
playground: "auth"
---
```

When `playground` is set to `auth`:
- Authenticated users see the interactive playground
- Unauthenticated users see no playground

Combine with the `groups` property to restrict access to specific user groups:

```yaml
---
title: "Admin endpoint"
api: "POST /admin/users"
playground: "auth"
groups: ["admin", "developer"]
public: true
---
```

### Hide specific API sections

Use custom CSS to hide specific sections of API documentation. Create a `style.css` file in your repository:

```css
/* Hide the Authorization section */
.api-section[data-section="authorization"] {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide the Authentication section */
.api-section[data-section="authentication"] {
  display: none;
}
```

<Note>
  API section selectors may vary. Use your browser's inspect element tool to identify the correct selectors for the sections you want to hide.
</Note>

## Hiding the sidebar

Control sidebar visibility on specific pages using the `mode` frontmatter property.

### Hide sidebar on a single page

Use the `center` mode to hide both the sidebar and table of contents:

```yaml
---
title: "Landing page"
mode: "center"
---
```

Use the `custom` mode for a minimal layout with only the top navbar:

```yaml
---
title: "Custom landing page"
mode: "custom"
---
```

Available layout modes:
- `default` - Standard layout with sidebar and table of contents
- `wide` - Hides table of contents for wider content
- `center` - Hides sidebar and table of contents
- `custom` - Minimal layout with only the navbar

### Hide sidebar globally with CSS

Create a `style.css` file to hide the sidebar across all pages:

```css
#sidebar {
  display: none !important;
}

/* Adjust content area to fill the space */
#content-area {
  margin-left: 0 !important;
}
```

<Warning>
  Hiding the sidebar globally can make navigation difficult. Consider using page-specific layout modes instead.
</Warning>

## Hiding the Mintlify badge

The "Powered by Mintlify" badge appears in the footer on free plans. This badge is automatically removed on paid plans.

To remove the badge, upgrade to a paid plan through your [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

<Note>
  Attempting to hide the Mintlify badge with custom CSS on free plans violates the terms of service.
</Note>

## Hiding other UI components

Use custom CSS to hide additional UI elements. Create a `style.css` file in your repository and target specific elements using their identifiers or selectors.

### Common elements to hide

```css
/* Hide the search bar */
#search-bar-entry {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide the feedback toolbar */
#feedback-toolbar {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide the table of contents */
#table-of-contents {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide pagination */
#pagination {
  display: none;
}

/* Hide the page context menu */
#page-context-menu {
  display: none;
}
```

### Available identifiers

Mintlify provides identifiers for common UI elements. Use inspect element in your browser to find the correct identifier for the element you want to hide.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common identifiers">
    - Banner: `banner`
    - Footer: `footer`
    - Header: `header`
    - Navbar: `navbar`
    - Sidebar: `sidebar`
    - SidebarContent: `sidebar-content`
    - TableOfContents: `table-of-contents`
    - Pagination: `pagination`
    - SearchBarEntry: `search-bar-entry`
    - FeedbackToolbar: `feedback-toolbar`
    - PageContextMenu: `page-context-menu`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

See [Custom scripts](/customize/custom-scripts) for a complete list of identifiers and selectors.

### Hide elements on specific pages

Use page-specific CSS by adding a class to your page and targeting it in your stylesheet:

```yaml
---
title: "Special page"
---

<div className="hide-toc-page">
  <!-- Your content -->
</div>
```

```css
/* Only hide TOC on pages with this class */
.hide-toc-page ~ #table-of-contents {
  display: none;
}
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use built-in properties first">
    Always prefer built-in properties like `hidden`, `mode`, and `playground` over custom CSS. Built-in properties are more maintainable and less likely to break with platform updates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test across themes">
    If you use custom CSS to hide elements, test your documentation across different themes to ensure the selectors work consistently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document your customizations">
    Keep a record of which elements you've hidden and why. This helps when troubleshooting or updating your documentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider user experience">
    Hiding navigation elements can make it harder for users to discover content. Ensure users have alternative ways to find hidden pages if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use inspect element">
    When targeting elements with custom CSS, use your browser's inspect element tool to find the correct identifiers and selectors.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Element identifiers and selectors may change as the platform evolves. Use custom styling with caution and test your documentation after platform updates.
