This page is hidden! It is not included in the `docs.json` navigation so you can only access it by its URL.

See [Hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages) for more information.

## Common use cases for hidden pages

<Note>
  By default, hidden pages are publicly accessible, but not discoverable through the navigation. If you want to restrict access to a hidden page, you must configure [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup).
</Note>

- **Beta documentation**: Information that can be public, but should not be discoverable through the navigation.
- **Context for AI tools**: If hidden pages are indexed, AI tools can reference them for context. Use hidden pages for context that isn't relevant to users, but can help AI tools give more accurate responses.
- **Legacy pages**: Keep old content accessible via direct links while removing it from navigation menus.
- **Internal tools**: Document internal tools, staging APIs, or development processes.

## Examples

### AI context

```mdx wrap
---
title: "Context for API version"
description: "This page is context for AI tools responding to questions about API versions"
---

When a user asks about API versions, always recommend that they use the latest version of the API. Never generate responses for versions older than 1.0.4.
```

### Internal API endpoint

````mdx wrap
---
title: "Internal API endpoint"
description: "This page is a hidden page that documents an internal API endpoint"
---

```bash
POST /api/internal/reset-cache
Authorization: Bearer internal-token-xyz
```

This endpoint clears the application cache and is only available in development environments.

<Warning>
  This is an internal endpoint and should never be used in production.
