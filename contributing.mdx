Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mintlify! There are multiple ways to
contribute, please feel free to ask for help on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/mintlify-users/shared_invite/zt-1xfzz6x35-f4o4WCYfpvLhSj3O7WAOMA) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/mintlify/mint/issues).

Everyone who contributes to Mintlify is expected to:

- Read and follow the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct). We expect
  everyone in our community to be welcoming, helpful, and respectful.

We also encourage anyone interested in contributing to check out all the
information here in our contributing guide, especially the
[contribution guidelines and standards](/contributing/#contribution-guidelines-and-standards).

We greatly appreciate your help! 💚

## Ways to contribute

Make sure you have familiarized yourself with [Development](/development).

- Before opening a new issue, check if a similar issue or pull request already exists.
- Create a pull request with your changes and write a summary,
  as well as a test plan for the changes.
- When the PR is marked as ready for review,
  the engineering team will be notified and a contributor will handle it.

## Contribution Tools

We are using contribution tools to simplify following our standards.

<Info>
  Staged files are linted and formatted automatically on `pre-commit`.
</Info>

- [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) - Analyzes code using multiple linting configurations/rules.
- [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) - Used to format text files.
- [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) - Used to set up and manage git hooks.
- [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) - Runs eslint/prettier against staged files.
- [pre-commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) - Validates and cleans up git commits
  by running the above tools automatically, using a git hook.

### Manual usage

It is possible and sometimes helpful to run the contribution tools manually.

- linting with `eslint`: `yarn lint`
- formatting with `prettier`: `yarn format`
- install git hooks (triggered automatically on `yarn install`): `yarn prepare`
- run `lint-staged` to check before committing and triggering the `pre-commit` git hook: `yarn lint-staged`

### Visual Studio Code

To format the code as you make changes you can install the [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension.

<Tip>Add the following to your User Settings to run prettier on save.</Tip>

```
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when trying to commit,
it could be because one of the tools fails to conclude successfully.

<Warning>
  `lint-staged` is using `--max-warnings 0`, which does not allow any warnings
  in staged files.
</Warning>

If warnings and errors cannot be resolved in any way,
or if refactoring old code, that includes warnings,
one of the following workarounds can be used.

- Use `--no-verify`.

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

- Disable `eslint` rule for line/file.

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
const x: any = {};
```

- Fix the warning with [type assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions), [utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) and [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).
- Discuss the issue or ask for help in an [issue](https://github.com/mintlify/mint/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/mintlify/mint/pulls).

<Tip>
  If you need help or if you encounter errors or warnings, don't hesitate to ask
  a question on [Slack](https://mintlify.com/community) or
  [GitHub](https://github.com/mintlify/mint/issues).

## Contribution guidelines and standards

Contributors of Mintlify are expected to:

- Read and follow the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
- Read and follow the [Mintlify code style](/contributing/#style).
- Code contribution guidelines are incomplete while Mintlify is still being developed and evolving,
  and may change later.

## Style

Projects should contain an `eslint` and a `prettier` config.
Please refer to these files for style rules.

<Tip>
  Shared configurations can be found in this
  [repository](https://github.com/mintlify/config).
</Tip>

## Git branching model

We are following [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) when creating branches and are doing back merges from `main` to `dev` to reduce the overhead of PR's. Please refer to the following rules when creating or merging branches:

### Feature branches

- Based on `dev`
- After finishing your work, open a PR, that targets `main`
- Merge to `main` after approval
- Can be squashed

### Release branches

- Based on `dev`
- After finishing the release, open a PR, that targets `main`
- Merge to `main` after approval
- Don't squash, as it messes with git history and causes conflicts
- Merge `main` to `dev` after successfully closing the PR

### Hotfix branches

- Based on `main` when the bug is on `main`, based on `dev` when the bug is exclusively on `dev`
- After finishing the fix, open a PR, that targets the base branch.
- Merge to target branch after approval
- Can be squashed
- Merge `main` to `dev` after successfully closing the PR, if the PR is based on `main`

### Squash

- Whenever you want to squash commits, make sure that the branch is immediately deleted afterwards and not merged to anything else as it can cause conflicts on all changed files.
- When merging release branches don't squash old commits or commits, that have been squashed already

### Rebase/Force-push

- This means rewriting git history. Can be used on feature branches, if you are working alone on it and nobody is reviewing it already.
- Only do this if you are certain that nobody pulled this branch, because their branch will be broken and unusable and it means potentially loosing changes or having a lot of conflicts.
