Set up a local environment to work in your preferred IDE and view local previews of changes to your documentation.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.17.0 or higher (LTS versions recommended) installed

## Locate your repository

1. Go to the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard.
2. Note your repository location. It will be in one of these formats:
   - `mintlify-community/docs-{org-name}-{id}` (Mintlify-hosted repository)
   - `your-org/your-repo` (your own GitHub repository)

## Set up your local environment

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Your own repository">
    If your repository is under your own GitHub organization or account, follow these steps.

    <Tip>
      **GitHub App required.** To enable automatic deployments when you push changes, you must install the GitHub app. See [GitHub](/deploy/github) for more information.
    </Tip>


    <Steps>
      <Step title="Clone your repository">
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
        cd your-repo
        ```

        <Tip>
          Replace `your-org/your-repo` with your actual repository details from [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings).
        </Tip>
      </Step>
    <Step title="Install the CLI">
      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash npm
        npm i -g mint
        ```

        ```bash pnpm
        pnpm add -g mint
        ```
      </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Preview locally">

    Navigate to your documentation directory (where `docs.json` is located):

    ```bash
    mint dev
    ```

    Your preview is available at `http://localhost:3000`. If that port is already in use, the CLI will use the next available port.
    </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mintlify-hosted repository">
    If your repository is in the `mintlify-community` organization, follow these steps.
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Clone the repository">
        You can clone your repository as a private or public repository. Public repositories are visible to anyone who navigates to the repository URL. Private repositories are only visible to people in your organization. We recommend cloning as a private repository unless you want people to be able to view your repository.
        
        On the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard, select **Clone as private** or **Clone as public**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install the CLI">

          ```bash npm
          npm i -g mint
          ```
      
      </Step>
      <Step title="Preview locally">
        Navigate to your documentation directory (where your `docs.json` file is located) and run:
        ```bash
        mint dev
        ```
        Your preview is available at `http://localhost:3000`. If that port is already in use, the CLI will use the next available port.
