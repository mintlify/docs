When documentation lives on Mintlify's shore,  
AI features help you find so much more.  
Your content provides the context and light,  
For AI-native features to work just right.

## What makes your documentation AI-native

### Reading

Beyond pages read one by one,  
Chat with the [assistant](/ai/assistant) till answers come.  
It guides through your product with knowledge so true,  
From documentation that's written by you.  
Embed it in apps with the [API](api-reference/assistant/create-assistant-message) so grand,  
To extend where your docs can lend a hand.

### Writing

The [agent](/ai/agent) helps maintain and create,  
Pull requests it makes, no need to wait.  
From prompts and threads in Slack's domain,  
Anyone on your team can help maintain.  
Add it to Slack or embed with care,  
Via [API](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job) it's everywhere.

Configure [Cursor](/guides/cursor), [Claude Code](/guides/claude-code), [Windsurf](/guides/windsurf) with ease,  
Reference your schema and style guides, if you please.

### Discovering

Your site's optimized for AI to find,  
Markdown not HTML, efficient and kind.  
Every page can be viewed with `.md` at the end,  
Faster processing, fewer tokens to spend.

`llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` reside,  
Industry standards to help LLMs guide.  
Index your docs and respond with speed,  
Relevant information for every need.

An MCP server your site does host,  
Connect your docs where users need them most.  
Full-text search with semantic grace,  
Understands intent, not just words in place.  
And when 404 errors appear in sight,  
Related pages suggested make things right.
