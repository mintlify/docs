Mintlify makes it easy to create professional documentation without any coding knowledge. This guide walks you through everything you need to know to get started.

## What is Mintlify?

Mintlify is a platform for creating and hosting documentation websites. Think of it like a specialized website builder designed specifically for documentation—similar to how Squarespace or Wix work for regular websites, but optimized for technical content.

You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or understand technical concepts like Git to use Mintlify effectively.

## Getting started

### Create your account

1. Visit [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start) to create your account.
2. Follow the onboarding steps to set up your first documentation site.
3. After completing onboarding, your documentation site is automatically created and available at a URL like `https://your-project-name.mintlify.app`.

You can find your site's URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

### Connect to GitHub

Mintlify stores your documentation files on GitHub, a popular platform for storing and managing files. Don't worry—you don't need to learn how to use GitHub directly. Mintlify handles all the technical details for you.

During onboarding, you'll be prompted to:
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2. Allow Mintlify to connect to your GitHub account.
3. Let Mintlify create a repository (a folder for your documentation files).

This connection allows Mintlify to save your work and keep track of changes automatically.

## Using the web editor

The web editor is your main workspace for creating and editing documentation. It provides a visual interface where you can see your changes in real-time.

### Access the editor

1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Click **Editor** in the left sidebar.

    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Navigate your documentation

The left sidebar shows all your documentation files organized in folders. Click any file to open and edit it.

Your documentation starts with a few default pages:
- **index.mdx**: Your homepage (the first page visitors see)
- **quickstart.mdx**: A getting started guide
- Additional pages depending on your template

### Edit content

Click any page in the sidebar to start editing. The editor works like a word processor with some special features:

1. **Type naturally**: Just start typing to add or change text.
2. **Format text**: Use the toolbar to make text bold, italic, or create headings.
3. **Add components**: Type `/` to open a menu of special elements you can add:
   - Code blocks for showing code examples
   - Callout boxes to highlight important information
   - Cards for organizing content visually
   - Tabs for showing multiple options
   - And many more

<Tip>
  The editor shows you exactly how your documentation will look to visitors. What you see is what you get.
</Tip>

### Add images

To add an image to your documentation:

1. Click where you want the image to appear.
2. Type `/` and select **Image** from the menu.
3. Upload your image file or paste a URL.
4. Add a description (this helps with accessibility and search engines).

### Create new pages

To add a new page to your documentation:

1. Click the **+** button next to the file list in the sidebar.
2. Choose **New page**.
3. Give your page a name and title.
4. Start adding content.

<Note>
  New pages are automatically saved but won't appear on your live site until you publish them.
</Note>

### Organize pages

You can organize your documentation into sections:

1. Click the **+** button in the sidebar.
2. Choose **New folder** to create a section.
3. Drag and drop pages into folders to organize them.
4. Rename folders by right-clicking them.

## Publishing your changes

When you're happy with your edits, click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner. Your changes will be live on your documentation site within a few minutes.

<Info>
  Publishing is safe—you can always make more changes and publish again. Each publish creates a snapshot of your documentation that you can return to if needed.
</Info>

## Customizing your site

### Change colors and appearance

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar.
3. Select **Appearance** to customize:
   - Your site's colors
   - Logo and favicon (the small icon in browser tabs)
   - Font choices
   - Light and dark mode settings

### Set up a custom domain

Instead of using `your-project-name.mintlify.app`, you can use your own domain like `docs.yourcompany.com`:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Domain** in your dashboard.
2. Enter your desired domain name.
3. Follow the instructions to update your domain settings with your domain provider.

<Info>
  If you're not familiar with domain settings, ask your IT team or domain provider for help with the DNS configuration step.
</Info>

### Organize navigation

Control how pages appear in your site's navigation menu:

1. In the web editor, look for the **Navigation** panel.
2. Drag and drop pages to reorder them.
3. Create groups to organize related pages together.
4. Hide pages that you're not ready to show yet.

## Getting help with AI

Mintlify includes an AI assistant that can help you write and improve your documentation.

### Use the agent

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows) to open the agent panel, or click the agent button in the top navigation.

You can ask the agent to:
- Write new documentation pages
- Improve existing content
- Fix formatting issues
- Add components and examples
- Reorganize content

For example, try asking:
- "Create a getting started guide for our API"
- "Add a troubleshooting section to this page"
- "Make this explanation simpler"

The agent will make suggestions and create pull requests (proposed changes) that you can review before publishing.

## Common tasks

### Add a code example

1. Type `/` and select **Code block**.
2. Choose the programming language.
3. Paste or type your code.
4. Add a title or description if needed.

### Create a callout box

Callout boxes highlight important information:

1. Type `/` and select **Callout**.
2. Choose the type:
   - **Note**: General information
   - **Tip**: Helpful suggestions
   - **Warning**: Important cautions
   - **Info**: Additional context

### Add a table

1. Type `/` and select **Table**.
2. Choose the number of rows and columns.
3. Fill in your content.
4. Use the toolbar to add or remove rows and columns.

### Embed a video

1. Type `/` and select **Video** or **Frame**.
2. Paste the URL of your video (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.).
3. The video will be embedded directly in your documentation.

## Tips for success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple">
    Begin with just a few essential pages. You can always add more content later. Focus on what your users need most.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use clear headings">
    Break up your content with descriptive headings. This makes it easier for readers to scan and find information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add visuals">
    Screenshots, diagrams, and videos help explain complex concepts. A picture really is worth a thousand words.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Preview before publishing">
    Always review your changes in the editor preview before publishing. Check for typos and make sure everything looks right.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep it updated">
    Set a regular schedule to review and update your documentation. Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation.
