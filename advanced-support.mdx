  <Accordion title="What happens during QBRs?">
    Quarterly Business Reviews are strategic working sessions where we:

    - Review your documentation success metrics and usage patterns
    - Discuss what's working well and where you're experiencing challenges
    - Align on your documentation priorities for the next 6-12 months
    - Identify new Mintlify capabilities that could support your goals
    - Plan specific milestones and success measures for the upcoming quarter

    Your CSM comes prepared with insights from your analytics, recent conversations, and product updates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does feature request tracking work?">
    Every Dedicated CSM customer gets a shared feature request tracker where you can:

    - Submit feature requests with context and priority
    - See status updates as requests move through review and development
    - Track which features have been shipped
    - Provide feedback and additional details as features are scoped

    Your CSM reviews this tracker regularly and escalates priority items directly to our product team.
