## FAQ

### Dedicated CSM

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between a dedicated CSM and standard support?">
    Standard support is delivered via the dashboard or support@mintlify.com with a 24-48 hour response SLA. A Dedicated CSM includes both a primary point of contact and a dedicated Slack channel. The main differences are:

    - **Response time:** 4 hours for US customers during business hours versus 24-48 hours for standard support
    - **Relationship:** One person who knows your setup versus a support team rotation
    - **Proactive engagement:** Monthly check-ins and QBRs versus reactive support
    - **Product influence:** Direct escalation to the product team and input on the roadmap
    - **Strategic planning:** Quarterly business reviews and success planning
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is a dedicated CSM priced at a premium?">
    You're getting a person who knows your team, your setup, and your goals—not a support queue. This includes:

    - 4-hour response SLA (versus 24-48 hours for standard support)
    - Monthly check-ins and quarterly business reviews
    - Direct influence on what we build
    - Priority escalation for bugs and incidents
    - Curated feature updates and enablement materials

    This is premium, high-touch service calibrated for teams where fast resolution and strategic partnership matter. If you want faster support without the full CSM relationship, our advanced Slack support option gives you a dedicated channel with 24-hour response times at a lower price point.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does feature request tracking work?">
    Every dedicated CSM customer gets a shared Google Sheet tracker where you can:

    - Submit feature requests with context and priority
    - See status updates as requests move through review and development
    - Track which features have been shipped
    - Provide feedback and additional details as features are scoped

    Your CSM reviews this tracker regularly and escalates priority items directly to our product team.

### Advanced Slack support

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between advanced Slack support and standard support?">
    Standard support (included with Pro and Enterprise plans) is delivered via the dashboard or support@mintlify.com with a 24-48 hour response SLA. Advanced Slack support includes:

    - Dedicated Slack channel versus email/dashboard support
    - 24-hour response SLA versus 24-48 hours for standard support
    - Expedited bug escalation to the Mintlify engineering team
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is advanced Slack support priced separately?">
    You're getting a dedicated Slack channel with our support team plus expedited engineering escalation for bugs and incidents—not email support with 24-48 hour response times. This is premium support for teams that need faster answers without the full strategic CSM relationship.
