## Dedicated CSM

A Dedicated Customer Success Manager is your primary point of contact who knows your team, your documentation setup, and your business goals. This isn't a support queue—it's a strategic partnership designed to ensure you're getting maximum value from Mintlify.

Includes:

- Assigned CSM: One person who understands your organization's specific needs and documentation strategy
- 4-hour response SLA: Get first responses within 4 hours during US business hours (9AM-5PM PST), 24 hours for international customers
- Monthly check-ins: Regular touchpoints to address questions, gather feedback and go over product updates
- Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs): Strategic sessions to align on what's working, what's not, and where your documentation needs are heading
- Dedicated Slack channel: Direct line to your CSM and support team for quick questions and troubleshooting
- Feature request tracking: Shared Google Sheet tracker
- Product influence: Your feedback is escalated directly to our product team—you get to shape what we build
- Curated updates: Your CSM shares relevant feature releases and capabilities via Slack as they launch
- Priority escalation: Expedited resolution for non-critical bugs and priority incident management

### When to choose Dedicated CSM

Best for teams that:

- Need a strategic partner who understands their documentation goals and can provide proactive guidance
- Require fast response times (4 hours) for time-sensitive issues
- Want monthly touchpoints and quarterly strategic planning sessions
- Are scaling their documentation and need ongoing optimization support
- Want influence over Mintlify's product roadmap

### What happens during QBRs?

Quarterly Business Reviews are strategic working sessions where we:

- Review your documentation success metrics and usage patterns
- Discuss what's working well and where you're experiencing challenges
- Align on your documentation priorities for the next 6-12 months
- Identify new Mintlify capabilities that could support your goals
- Plan specific milestones and success measures for the upcoming quarter

Your CSM comes prepared with insights from your analytics, recent conversations, and product updates. These aren't status meetings—they're planning sessions designed to ensure your documentation strategy evolves with your business.

## Advanced Slack Support

### What you get

Advanced Slack Support gives you a dedicated Slack channel with our support team for quick questions, troubleshooting, and bug escalation—without the full CSM relationship.

Includes:

- Dedicated Slack channel: Direct access to our support engineers for product help and technical questions
- 24-hour response SLA: Guaranteed first response within 24 hours
- Bug & incident escalation: Expedited escalation to engineering for bugs and incidents
- Troubleshooting support: Help with configuration, implementation questions, and technical issues

### When to choose Advanced Slack Support

Best for teams that:

- Need faster response times (24 hours vs. 24-48 hours) but don't require strategic partnership
- Prefer Slack for support communication rather than email
- Want quick access to troubleshooting help without scheduled check-ins
- Have experienced technical teams who need rapid answers to unblock themselves

## FAQ

### Dedicated CSM

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between a Dedicated CSM and Standard Support?">
    Standard Support (available on Pro and Enterprise plans) is delivered via the dashboard or support@mintlify.com with a 24-48 hour response SLA. A Dedicated CSM includes both a primary point of contact and a dedicated Slack channel. The main differences are:

    - Response time: 4 hours for US customers during business hours vs. 24-48 hours
    - Relationship: One person who knows your setup vs. support team rotation
    - Proactive engagement: Monthly check-ins and QBRs vs. reactive support
    - Product influence: Direct escalation to product team and input on roadmap
    - Strategic planning: Quarterly business reviews and success planning
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is Dedicated CSM priced at a premium?">
    You're getting a person who knows your team, your setup, and your goals—not a support queue. This includes:

    - 4-hour response SLA (vs. 24-48 hours for standard support)
    - Monthly check-ins and quarterly business reviews
    - Direct influence on what we build
    - Priority escalation for bugs and incidents
    - Curated feature updates and enablement materials

    This is premium, high-touch service calibrated for teams where fast resolution and strategic partnership matter.

    If you want faster support without the full CSM relationship, our Advanced Slack Support option gives you a dedicated channel with 24-hour response times at a lower price point.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does feature request tracking work?">
    Every Dedicated CSM customer gets a shared Google Sheet tracker where you can:

    - Submit feature requests with context and priority
    - See status updates as requests move through review and development
    - Track which features have been shipped
    - Provide feedback and additional details as features are scoped

    Your CSM reviews this tracker regularly and escalates priority items directly to our product team.

### Advanced Slack Support

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Advanced Slack Support and Standard Support?">
    Standard Support (available on Pro and Enterprise plans) is delivered via the dashboard or support@mintlify.com with a 24-48 hour response SLA. Advanced Slack Support includes:

    - Dedicated Slack channel vs. email/dashboard support
    - 24-hour response SLA vs. 24-48 hours
    - Expedited bug escalation to engineering
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is Advanced Slack Support priced separately?">
    You're getting a dedicated Slack channel with our support team plus expedited engineering escalation for bugs and incidents—not email support with 24-48 hour response times. This is premium support for teams that need faster answers without the full strategic CSM relationship.
