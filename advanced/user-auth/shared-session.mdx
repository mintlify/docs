title: 'Shared Session Auth'
description: 'Seamlessly share user sessions between your dashboard and your docs'
---

This method utilizes the session authentication info already stored in your user’s browser to create a seamless documentation experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that uses session authentication to identify users, and responds with a JSON payload following the [UserInfo](./sending-data) format.

    If the API domain does not *exactly match* the docs domain:
      - Add the docs domain to your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (must not be `*`)
      - Ensure your API’s `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header is `true`
      <Warning>
        These CORS options only need to be enabled on the *single endpoint* responsible for returning user information. We do not recommend enabling these options on all dashboard endpoints.
      </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your User Auth settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/integrations) and add the API URL and your Login URL to your User Auth settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at subdomain

I have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. My dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create another dashboard endpoint `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` which identifies the user using session auth, and responds with their custom data according to Mintlify’s specification. I then add `https://docs.foo.com` to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` allow-list **for this route only**, and ensure my `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` configuration is set to `true` **for this route only**.

I then go to the Mintlify dashboard settings and enter `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` for the API URL field.

### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at root

I have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. My dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create another dashboard endpoint `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` which identifies the user using session auth, and responds with their custom data according to Mintlify’s specification. I then add `https://foo.com` to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` allow-list **for this route only**, and ensure my `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` configuration is set to `true` **for this route only**.

I then go to the Mintlify dashboard settings and enter `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` for the API URL field.

### Dashboard at root, docs at root

I have a dashboard at `foo.com/dashboard`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. My dashboard API routes are hosted at `foo.com/api`. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I create another dashboard endpoint `foo.com/api/docs/user-info` which identifies the user using session auth, and responds with their custom data according to Mintlify’s specification.

I then go to the Mintlify dashboard settings and enter `https://foo.com/api/docs/user-info` for the API URL field.
