Depending on your authentication configuration, your API will respond with either a raw JSON object or a signed JWT. The shape of the data is the same for both:

```tsx
type UserInfo = {
  expiresAt?: number;
  groups?: string[];
  content?: Record<string, any>;
  apiPlaygroundInputs?: {
    header?: Record<string, any>;
    query?: Record<string, any>;
    cookie?: Record<string, any>;
    server?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

<ParamField
  path="expiresAt"
  type="number"
>
  The time at which this information should expire, in **seconds since epoch**. If the user loads the page and the current time is after this value, the stored data will be deleted.
  <Warning><b>For JWT Auth:</b> This is *not* the same as the `exp` claim of the JWT. The `exp` claim determines when a JWT should no longer be considered valid, and should be set as low as possible. In this case, it can probably be set to 10 seconds or lower. The `expiresAt` field determines when retrieved data should be considered stale, and can be anywhere from one day to several weeks.</Warning>
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  path="groups"
  type="string[]"
>
  A list of groups that the user belongs to. This will determine which pages should be shown to this user. If any of these groups is listed in the `groups` field of a pageâ€™s metadata, that page will be shown.
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  path="content"
  type="object"
>
  A bag of values that can be accessed from within MDX content using the `userContext` variable. For example, if you have supplied `{ firstName: 'Ronan' }` as your content field, you can use the following in your MDX: `Good morning, {userContext.firstName}!`
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  path="apiPlaygroundInputs"
  type="object"
>
  User-specific values that will be prefilled in the API playground if supplied. For example, if each of my customers makes requests at a specific subdomain, I can send `{ server: { subdomain: 'foo' } }` as my `apiPlaygroundInputs` field, and this value will be prefilled on any API page with this `subdomain` value.

  <Note>The`header`, `query`, and `cookie` fields will only be prefilled if they are part of your [security scheme](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/). Creating a standard header parameter named `Authorization` is not sufficient to enable this feature. To know if a field will be prefilled, navigate to your existing docs and check if the field is in either the `Authorization` or `Server` section.</Note>
</ParamField>
