title: 'Choosing an Auth Method'
description: 'How to decide which auth method is right for your docs'

Before your users can access personalized content, they must be authenticated. Mintlify supports two methods of authenticating users:

1. **Shared Session**: Utilize the same session token used by your dashboard to authenticate users.
2. **JWT**: Use your own login flow to send user info to your docs via a JWT in the URL.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shared Session">

    - You have a dashboard or other user portal hosted at your domain.
    - Your users' session credentials are stored as cookies.
    - You can create a new API endpoint at the same origin or a subdomain of your dashboard.
      - If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`
      - If your dashboard is at `dash.foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `dash.foo.com` or `*.dash.foo.com`
    - Your docs are hosted at the same domain as your dashboard.
      - If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`
      - If your dashboard is at `*.foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JWT">
  
    - You have some existing login flow.
    - You can add a final step in this login flow that creates a JWT and redirects to the docs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pros & Cons

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shared Session">
    Pros:

    - Users that are logged into your dashboard are automatically logged into your docs
    - Your users' sessions are persistent, meaning you can refresh data without requiring additional login
    - Minimal setup required

    Cons:

    - Your docs will make a request to your backend, which may be undesirable
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JWT">
    Pros:

    - No dashboard needed
    - Reduced risk of API endpoint abuse
    - Zero CORS configuration

    Cons:

    - Must build new functionality around your existing login flow
    - Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are completely decoupled, so users will need to log in to your dashboard and your docs separately
    - Every time you want to refresh user data, your users must re-login to your docs
      - If your users' data changes frequently, you must require your users to log in frequently or risk having stale data in the docs
      - If your users' data rarely changes, this shouldn't be a problem
