## vercel.json file

The `vercel.json` file configures how your project is built and deployed. It sits in your project's root directory and controls various aspects of your deployment, including routing, redirects, headers, and build settings.

We use the `rewrites` configuration to proxy requests from your main domain to your documentation.

Rewrites map incoming requests to different destinations without changing the URL in the browser. When someone visits `yoursite.com/docs`, Vercel will internally fetch content from `your-subdomain.mintlify.dev/docs` but the user will still see `yoursite.com/docs` in their browser. This is different from redirects, which would send users to a different URL entirely.

You can customize the subpath to any value you prefer, such as `/docs`, `/help`, or `/guides`. Additionally, you can use deeply nested subpaths like `/product/docs`.

## Repository structure

Your documentation files must be organized within your repository to match your chosen subpath structure. For example, if you want your documentation at `yoursite.com/docs`, you would create a `docs/` directory with all of your documentation files.

## Configuration

To host your documentation at a custom subpath using Vercel, add the following configuration to your `vercel.json` file. This example uses `/docs`, but you can replace it with any subpath:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/docs",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs"
    },
    {
      "source": "/docs/:match*",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs/:match*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`source`**: The path pattern on your domain that triggers the rewrite.
- **`destination`**: Where the request should be proxied to.
- **`:match*`**: A wildcard that captures any path segments after your subpath.

For more information, see [Configuring projects with vercel.json: Rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#rewrites) in the Vercel documentation.

## Using external proxies with Vercel

If you're using an external proxy (like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront) in front of your Vercel deployment, you must configure it properly to avoid conflicts with Vercel's domain verification and SSL certificate provisioning.

Improper proxy configuration can prevent Vercel from provisioning Let's Encrypt SSL certificates and cause domain verification failures.

See the [supported providers](https://vercel.com/guides/how-to-setup-verified-proxy#supported-providers-verified-proxy-lite) in the Vercel documentation.

### Required path allowlist

Your external proxy must allow traffic to these specific paths without blocking, redirecting, or heavily caching:

- `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` - Required for Let's Encrypt certificate verification
- `/.well-known/vercel/*` - Required for Vercel domain verification

These paths should pass through directly to your Vercel deployment without modification.

### Header forwarding requirements

Ensure that your proxy correctly forwards the `HOST` header. Without proper header forwarding, verification requests will fail.

### Testing your proxy setup

To verify your proxy is correctly configured:

1. Test that `https://[yourdomain].com/.well-known/vercel/` returns a response.
2. Ensure SSL certificates are provisioning correctly in your Vercel dashboard.
3. Check that domain verification completes successfully.
