## vercel.json Configuration

To host your documentation at a custom subpath using Vercel, you need to add the
following configuration to your `vercel.json` file.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/docs",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs"
    },
    {
      "source": "/docs/:match*",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs/:match*"
    }
  ]
}
```
