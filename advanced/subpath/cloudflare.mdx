To host your documentation at a `/docs` subpath using Cloudflare, you will need to create and configure a Cloudflare Worker.

<Note>
  If your domain already points to another service, you will need to remove the existing DNS record. This process can cause brief downtime.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Cloudflare account
- A domain name (can be managed on or off Cloudflare)

## Set up a Cloudflare Worker

Create a Cloudflare Worker by following the [Cloudflare Workers getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/dashboard/), if you have not already.

<Warning>
  If your DNS provider is Cloudflare, do not use proxying for the CNAME record.
</Warning>

### Configure routing

In your Cloudflare dashboard, select **Edit Code** and add the following script into your Worker's code. See the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/dashboard/#development) for more information on editing a Worker.


<Tip>
  Replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain and `[YOUR_DOMAIN]` with your website's base URL.
</Tip>

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    
    // Route /docs traffic to Mintlify
    if (url.pathname.startsWith('/docs')) {
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";
      
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;
      
      const proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      
      return fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
    
    // Route all other traffic to your main site
    // Replace with your main site's URL
    return fetch(`https://your-main-site.com${url.pathname}${url.search}`);
  }
}
```

Select `Deploy` and wait for the changes to propagate (it can take up to a few
hours).

### Test your Worker

After your code deploys, test your Worker to ensure it routes to your Mintlify docs.

1. Test using the Worker's preview URL: `your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/docs`
2. Verify the Worker routes to your Mintlify docs and your website.

### Resolve DNS conflicts

If your domain already points to another service, you must remove the existing DNS record. Your Cloudflare Worker must be configured to control all traffic for your domain.

1. Delete the existing DNS record for your domain. See [Delete DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#delete-dns-records) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information.
2. Return to your Worker and add your custom domain.

### Add custom domain

1. In your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), navigate to your Worker.
2. Go to **Settings > Domains & Routes > Add > Custom Domain**.
3. Add your domain. 

<Tip>
  We recommend you add your domain both with and without `www.` prepended.
</Tip>

See [Add a custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information.
