## Create Cloudflare Worker

Navigate to the `Workers & Pages > Create application > Create worker`. You
should be presented with the following screen where you can create a new
Cloudflare worker.

</Frame>

<Warning>
    Keep in mind: If your DNS provider is Cloudflare you should not use proxying for the CNAME record
</Warning>

### Add custom domain

Once the worker is created, click `Configure worker`. Navigate to the worker
`Settings > Triggers`. Click on `Add Custom Domain` to add your desired domain
into the list - we recommend you add both the version with and without `www.`
prepended to the domain.

  />
</Frame>

If you have trouble setting up a custom subdirectory,
[contact our support team](https://mintlify.com/docs/support) and we'll walk you through
upgrading your hosting with us.

### Edit Worker Script

Click on `Edit Code` and add the following script into the worker's code.

<Tip>
  Edit `DOCS_URL` by replacing `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain and
  `CUSTOM_URL` with your website's base URL.
</Tip>

```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);
    // If the request is to the docs subdirectory
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Then Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";

      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;

      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);

      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");

      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // if no action found, play the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
}
```

Click on `Deploy` and wait for the changes to propagate (it can take up to a few
hours).

## Webflow custom routing
If you use Webflow to host your main site and want to serve Mintlify docs at `/docs` on the same domain, you'll need to configure custom routing through Cloudflare Workers to proxy all non-docs traffic to your main site.

<Warning>
  Make sure your main site is set up on a staging domain before deploying this Worker, or visitors to your main site will see errors.
</Warning>

1. In Webflow, set up a landing page for your main site like `landing.yoursite.com`. This will be the page that visitors see when they visit your site.
2. Deploy your main site to the landing page. This ensures that your main site remains accessible while you configure the Worker.
3. To avoid conflicts, update any absolute URLs in your main site to be relative.
4. In Cloudflare, select **Edit Code** and add the following script into your Worker's code.

  <Tip> Replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain, `[YOUR_DOMAIN]` with your website's base URL, and `[STAGING_DOMAIN]` with your staging domain URL. </Tip>

  ```javascript
  addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
  });
  async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);
    // If the request is to the docs subdirectory
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";
      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;
      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");
      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
    // Route everything else to main site
    const MAIN_SITE_URL = "[STAGING_DOMAIN]";
    if (MAIN_SITE_URL && MAIN_SITE_URL !== "[STAGING_DOMAIN]") {
      let mainSiteUrl = new URL(request.url);
      mainSiteUrl.hostname = MAIN_SITE_URL;
      return await fetch(mainSiteUrl, {
        method: request.method,
        headers: request.headers,
        body: request.body
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // If no action found, serve the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
  }
  ```
5. Select Deploy and wait for the changes to propagate, which can take up to a few hours.
