To host your documentation at a `/docs` subpath using Cloudflare, you will need to create and configure a Cloudflare Worker.

<Note>
  If your domain already points to another service, you will need to remove the existing DNS record. This process can cause brief downtime.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Cloudflare account
- A domain name (can be managed on or off Cloudflare)

## Set up a Cloudflare Worker

Create a Cloudflare Worker by following the [Cloudflare Workers getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/dashboard/), if you have not already.

<Warning>
  If your DNS provider is Cloudflare, do not use proxying for the CNAME record.
</Warning>

### Add custom domain

1. In your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), navigate to your Worker.
2. Go to **Settings > Domains & Routes > Add > Custom Domain**.
3. Add your domain. 

<Tip>
  We recommend you add your domain both with and without `www.` prepended.
</Tip>

See [Add a custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information. 

### Configure routing

In your Cloudflare dashboard, select **Edit Code** and add the following script into your Worker's code. See the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/dashboard/#development) for more information on editing a Worker.


<Tip>
  Replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain and `[YOUR_DOMAIN]` with your website's base URL.
</Tip>

```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);
    // If the request is to the docs subdirectory
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Then Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";

      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;

      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);

      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");

      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // if no action found, play the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
}
```

Select `Deploy` and wait for the changes to propagate (it can take up to a few
hours).

## Resolving DNS conflicts

If your domain already points to another service, you will see an error about an existing DNS record. Your Cloudflare Worker must be configured to control all traffic for your domain.

1. Delete the existing DNS record for your domain. See [Delete DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#delete-dns-records) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information.
2. Return to your Worker and add your custom domain.
