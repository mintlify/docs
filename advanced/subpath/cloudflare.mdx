---

To host your documentation at a `/docs` subpath using Cloudflare, you will need to create and configure a Cloudflare Worker.

<Info>
  Before you begin, you need a Cloudflare account and a domain name (can be managed on or off Cloudflare).
</Info>

## Set up a Cloudflare Worker

Create a Cloudflare Worker by following the [Cloudflare Workers getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/dashboard/), if you have not already.

<Warning>
  If your DNS provider is Cloudflare, do not use proxying for the CNAME record.
</Warning>

### Configure routing

In your Cloudflare dashboard, select **Edit Code** and add the following script into your Worker's code. See the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/dashboard/#development) for more information on editing a Worker.

<Tip>
  Replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain and `[YOUR_DOMAIN]` with your website's base URL.
</Tip>

```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);
    // If the request is to the docs subdirectory
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Then Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";

      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;

      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);

      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");

      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // if no action found, play the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
}
```

Select `Deploy` and wait for the changes to propagate (it can take up to a few
hours).

### Test your Worker

After your code deploys, test your Worker to ensure it routes to your Mintlify docs.

1. Test using the Worker's preview URL: `your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/docs`
2. Verify the Worker routes to your Mintlify docs and your website.

### Add custom domain

1. In your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), navigate to your Worker.
2. Go to **Settings > Domains & Routes > Add > Custom Domain**.
3. Add your domain. 

<Tip>
  We recommend you add your domain both with and without `www.` prepended.
</Tip>

See [Add a custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information. 

### Resolve DNS conflicts

If your domain already points to another service, you must remove the existing DNS record. Your Cloudflare Worker must be configured to control all traffic for your domain.

1. Delete the existing DNS record for your domain. See [Delete DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#delete-dns-records) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information.
2. Return to your Worker and add your custom domain.

## Webflow custom routing
If you use Webflow to host your main site and want to serve Mintlify docs at `/docs` on the same domain, you'll need to configure custom routing through Cloudflare Workers to proxy all non-docs traffic to your main site.

<Warning>
  Make sure your main site is set up on a landing page before deploying this Worker, or visitors to your main site will see errors.
</Warning>

1. In Webflow, set up a landing page for your main site like `landing.yoursite.com`. This will be the page that visitors see when they visit your site.
2. Deploy your main site to the landing page. This ensures that your main site remains accessible while you configure the Worker.
3. To avoid conflicts, update any absolute URLs in your main site to be relative.
4. In Cloudflare, select **Edit Code** and add the following script into your Worker's code.

  <Tip> Replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain, `[YOUR_DOMAIN]` with your website's base URL, and `[LANDING_DOMAIN]` with your landing page URL. </Tip>

  ```javascript
  addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
  });
  async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);
    // If the request is to the docs subdirectory
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";
      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;
      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");
      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
    // Route everything else to main site
    const MAIN_SITE_URL = "[LANDING_DOMAIN]";
    if (MAIN_SITE_URL && MAIN_SITE_URL !== "[LANDING_DOMAIN]") {
      let mainSiteUrl = new URL(request.url);
      mainSiteUrl.hostname = MAIN_SITE_URL;
      return await fetch(mainSiteUrl, {
        method: request.method,
        headers: request.headers,
        body: request.body
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // If no action found, serve the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
  }
  ```
5. Select Deploy and wait for the changes to propagate, which can take up to a few hours.
