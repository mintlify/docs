Custom JS allows you to add custom executable code globally. It is the equivalent of adding a `<script>` tag with JS code into every page.

## Adding Custom JavaScript

Any `.js` file inside the content directory of your docs will be included in every documentation page. For example, you can add the following `ga.js` file to enable [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics) across the entire documentation.

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag() {
  dataLayer.push(arguments);
}
gtag('js', new Date());

gtag('config', 'TAG_ID');
```
