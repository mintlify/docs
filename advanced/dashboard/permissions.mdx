An editor has access to your dashboard and web editor.

Anyone can contribute to your documentation by working locally and pushing changes to your repository, but there are key differences in how changes get deployed:

* **Editor changes**: When an editor publishes through the web editor or merges a pull request into your docs repository, changes deploy to your live site automatically.
* **Non-editor changes**: When a non-editor merges a pull request into your repository, you must manually trigger a deployment from your dashboard for those changes to appear on your live site.

## Add editors
By default, the team member who created your Mintlify organization has editor access. Add additional editors in the [Members](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members) page of your dashboard.

Editor seats are billed based on usage, and you can have as many editors as you need. See our [pricing page](https://mintlify.com/pricing) for more details.
