  The Mintlify Discovery API is only available on the Pro plan and above.

The Discovery API allows you to embed an AI chat experience grounded in your docs and continually kept up to date into any application of your choosing.
Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right places they need to get help.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to generate a Discovery API key in the [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/chat/widget):

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Create a Discovery API key"
    src="/images/generate-discovery-api-key.png"
  />
</Frame>

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use
the API for AI chat. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).
