    This page is dedicated to setting up your own MCP Server. If you are looking for information on using the Mintlify MCP Server, please refer to the [Installing and using the Mintlify MCP Server](/advanced/mcp/cli) page.
</Tip>

## Get started
Run `npm i mcp` to install the `mcp` CLI.

In the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp) go to `MCP Server` to see your unique installation command. This is the command to install your MCP Server with the `mcp` CLI.

## Start the MCP server locally
<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the server through the CLI">
        Run the following command to install the server:
        ```bash
        npx mcp add [your subdomain]
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the authentication token if applicable">
        If your API requires an authentication token, tell your end-customer to get it and apply it when given this response:
        ```
        > What is the Authorization (basic token)?
        ```
        Otherwise, you can skip this step.
        
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start your MCP server">
        You can now run:
        ```bash
        npm --prefix ~/.mcp/[your subdomain] start
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
