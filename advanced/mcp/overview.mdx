## MCP Generator

The MCP Generator is a CLI tool that generates an MCP server based on your company's documentation & OpenAPI specification if available. It takes in your documentation and a OpenAPI spec and outputs an MCP server that can be used with any MCP client. The MCP Generator is delivered via [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp) and generates an MCP server that can be used with any MCP client.

Mintlify enables you to create an MCP server that allows AI tools to interact with your docs in these key scenarios:

1. **Docs Q&A**, similar to our AI Chat. This is automatically enabled for your docs, no setup required.
2. **Real-time API querying**, if you have an OpenAPI spec, head to the `Mintlify Dashboard > Products > MCP Server` and hit the toggle to enable your OpenAPI spec.
   <Note>
     By enabling the OpenAPI toggle, you are allowing the MCP server to access
     **all** endpoints in your OpenAPI spec.
   </Note>
