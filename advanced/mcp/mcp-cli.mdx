<Tip>
    To get started with the MCP server make sure you have an API key. If you don't have one, navigate to `Settings > API Keys > Chat API Key` and create a new key.
</Tip>

## Start the MCP server locally
<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the server through the CLI">
        Run the following command to install the server:
        ```bash
        npx mcp add mintlify
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the authentication token">
        The following response will be given after running the previous command:
        ```
        > What is the Authorization (basic token)?
        ```
        Using your API chat key, copy the authentication token and paste it into the CLI.
        
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start your MCP server">
        You can now run:
        ```bash
        npm --prefix ~/.mcp/mintlify start
        ```
    </Step>
