<Tip>
  This page is dedicated to setting up your own MCP Server. If you are looking
  for information on using the Mintlify MCP Server, please refer to the
  [Installing and using the Mintlify MCP Server](/advanced/mcp/quickstart) page.
</Tip>

## Get started

Run `npm i @mintlify/mcp` to install the `@mintlify/mcp` CLI.

In the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp) go to `MCP Server`, on this page toggle to see your unique installation command. This is the command to install your MCP Server with the `@mintlify/mcp` CLI.

<Note>
  Make sure to toggle OpenAPI access to allow the MCP server to access **all**
  endpoints in your OpenAPI spec.
</Note>

## Start the MCP server locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the server through the CLI">
    Run the following command to install the server:
    
    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/mcp add [your subdomain]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the authentication token if applicable">
    If your API requires an authentication token, tell your end-customer to get
    it and apply it when given this response: ``` > What is the Authorization
    (basic token)? ``` Otherwise, you can skip this step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start your MCP server">
    You can now run: ```bash npm --prefix ~/.mcp/[your subdomain] start ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
