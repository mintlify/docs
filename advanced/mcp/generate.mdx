<Tip>
  This page to learn how to set up an MCP Server for your own documentation. If you are looking for information on using the Mintlify MCP Server, please refer to the [Installing and using the Mintlify MCP Server](/advanced/mcp/quickstart) page.
</Tip>

## Get started

Run `npm i @mintlify/mcp` to install the `@mintlify/mcp` CLI.

In the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp), navigate to `MCP Server`to see your unique installation command. This is the command to install your MCP Server with the `@mintlify/mcp` CLI.

<Note>
  Make sure to toggle OpenAPI access to allow the MCP server to access **all**
  endpoints in your OpenAPI spec.
</Note>

## Start the MCP server locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the server through the CLI">
    Run the following command to install the server:

    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/mcp add [your subdomain]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the authentication token if applicable">
    If your API requires an authentication token, tell your end-customer to get
    it and apply it when given this response: `> What is the Authorization
        (basic token)?` Otherwise, you can skip this step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start your MCP server">
    You can now run: `bash npm --prefix ~/.mcp/[your subdomain] start `
  </Step>
