## What is an MCP Server?

Model Context Protocol is a standard released by Anthropic in November 2024 to simplify how applications can provide context to large language models (LLMs). 

It enables LLMs to use external tools & services, with MCP servers exposing your data to AI and MCP clients allowing access to that data. For example, you can use an MCP client like Windsurf or Cursor to search for a pull request by using [GitHub’s MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github).

While MCPs have recently gained intense traction as a way to embed products into AI ecosystems, best practices are still evolving. 

We believe the most effective approach is to dynamically generate MCP servers based on existing data structures, like your OpenAPI spec. With a simple CLI installation, Mintlify enables you to do just that—automatically setting up an MCP server that allows AI tools to interact with your docs in these key scenarios:

1. **General information retrieval**, when users want to get a contextual answer
2. **Real-time API querying**, when users want AI to execute actions on their behalf
