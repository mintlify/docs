## MCP Generator

There are two components to MCP capabilities today:

1. The MCP Generator delivered via [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp)
2. The MCP Server that end-customers run locally

The MCP Generator is a CLI tool that generates an MCP server based on your company's documentation & OpenAPI specification if available. It takes in your documentation and a OpenAPI spec and outputs an MCP server that can be used with any MCP client.

The MCP Server is a simple HTTP server that listens for MCP client requests and returns the requested data.


## What is an MCP Server?

Model Context Protocol is a standard released by Anthropic in November 2024 to simplify how applications can provide context to large language models (LLMs). 

Mintlify enables you to set up an MCP server that allows AI tools to interact with your docs in these key scenarios:

1. **Docs Q&A**, similar to our AI Chat. This is automatically enabled for your docs, no setup required.
2. **Real-time API querying**, if you have an OpenAPI spec, head to the `Mintlify Dashboard > Products > MCP Server` and hit the toggle to enable your OpenAPI spec.
