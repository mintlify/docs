<Tip>
    This page is dedicated to the Mintlify MCP Server. If you are looking for information on generating your MCP, please refer to the [MCP Generator](/advanced/mcp/overview) page.
</Tip>

## Get started
To use the Mintlify MCP server you will need an [API key](https://mintlify.com/docs/advanced/rest-api/overview#authentication) from your Mintlify account. If you don't have one, navigate to `Settings > API Keys > Chat API Key` and create a new key.

## Start the MCP server locally
<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the server through the CLI">
        Run the following command to install the server:
        ```bash
        npx mcp add mintlify
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the authentication token">
        The following response will be given after running the previous command:
        ```
        > What is the Authorization (basic token)?
        ```
        Using your API chat key, copy the authentication token and paste it into the CLI.
        
    </Step>
    <Step title="Start your MCP server">
        You can now run:
        ```bash
        npm --prefix ~/.mcp/mintlify start
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

       Add the following to the `claude_desktop_config.json`: 
       ```json 
       {
        "mcpServers": {
            "mintlify": {
                "command": "npm",
                "args": [
                    "--prefix",
                    "~/.mcp/mintlify",
                    "start"
                ]
            }
        }
       }
       ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="If you see the hammer icon, you're all set!">
