## Global CSS

If you're searching for the design functions needed to seamlessly fit your docs into your brand, look no further. Now, you can alter design, layout, and variations for different device displays, all from a single style sheet.

## Web Editor

Built with markdown parsers and inspired by code editors like VS Code, the Web Editor lets you alter docs content on the web, commit and push in-editor, access a high-fidelity preview of your docs content next to code â€” without CLI, and preview valid markdown edits.
