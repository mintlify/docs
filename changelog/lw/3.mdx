## Themes

Themes enables you to transform the styling and layout of your documentation to fit your branding. We've unveiled three themes: **[Quill](https://starter-quill.mintlify.app/), [Prism](https://starter-prism.mintlify.app/), and [Venus](https://starter-venus.mintlify.app/).**

To try out any themes for yourself, just add the following line into your `mint.json` file with any of the following values:

```
"theme": "quill" | "prism" | "venus"
```

## Web Editor Branching 

The Web Editor allows users to alter your docs content right on the web without an IDE. Branches allow you to create separate versions of your documentation without affecting the main project â€” they're like parallel universes for code.

## User Auth

## OpenAPI Automations

When you're constantly shipping changes to your API, it's important to reflect those changes in your documentation as soon as possible. Our revamped setup makes autogenerating your API Reference docs seamless, removing the need for any manual labor to reflect changes in production.
