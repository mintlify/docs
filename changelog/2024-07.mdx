## Mintlify Widget

For `Pro` users, we introduced Mintlify Widget, an extension of your docs to
answer your users' questions when and where they asked. You can add this
AI-powered chatbot to any web page: your landing page, inside your product, or
on your existing documentation pages.

into easy-to-digest reports with AI-powered suggestions on how to improve your
product.
