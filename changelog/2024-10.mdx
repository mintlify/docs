## [Code Line Highlighting](/content/components/code#line-highlighting)

You can now highlight lines of code in your docs to emphasize and bring attention to important parts by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces `{}` and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```

````md
```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```
````

## Light mode code blocks

Code blocks now have a light mode variant which can be enabled by adding the following to your `mint.json`:

```json
"code": {
  "mode": "auto"
}
```

## Advanced Footer

You can now add more links to the standard footer. This upgrade
provides more consistency between landing pages and docs, or greater customization
if you want to spotlight specific pages like socials or status logs.

## New Landing Page

1. Showcasing vision for the future

It's been a year since we've last updated our landing page, and our team has shipped A LOT.

As we grow, we will no longer be just a documentation platform, but the platform for technical content, encompassing much more than just docs.

2. Feature our new customers

We've gotten to work with many incredible companies, and wanted to give them a shoutout.

3. Increase iteration velocity

Instead of building a standalone app, we built it in Webflow. This way, our entire team can contribute and experiment with the landing page.

## Filter search based on the current user

When user auth is enabled, search results are now filtered based on the current logged in user so that they only see the relevant content.

## Custom Prompts for AI Chat

You can now customize the prompts for the AI chat. Please reach out to [support](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) if you'd like to customize the prompts.

## Dashboard Improvements

- Consolidated the login and signup pages to decrease friction and confusion.
- Implemented the discovery login flow so that users that are members of multiple organizations can now switch between them.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed `suggestEdit` not showing up even when enabled.
- Fixed keyboard navigation for Search and Chat such that you can now use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the results.
- Don't allow search engines to crawl user-auth protected pages.
- Revalidate the cache when an org is deleted.
- We now use the Scalar OpenAPI parser to parse OpenAPI definitions which improves the performance, fixes parsing issues, and surfaces better error messages.
- Top-level descriptions are now supported in API reference pages autogenerated from OpenAPI definitions.
- Add in-line-style support for icons
- Fixed the pop-in of custom CSS in docs.
- Properly show in-line code styling in conjunction with links.
- Maintain scroll position when you click the back button in a browser.
