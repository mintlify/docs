## OpenAPI Reference Pages

- Endpoints defined by OpenAPI that are complex and recursive are now 98%
  smaller.
- We now show
  [additionalProperties](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/dictionaries/)
  in OpenAPI pages.

## File Uploads in API Playground

By default, API playground requests are proxied by Mintlify. Now you can use
`disableProxy` to disable this behavior and support request types like file
uploads.

## Mobile SEO improvements

We've fixed the mobile layout of our docs so that they are more SEO-friendly -
including adding proper aria tags to elements.

## Support Form

We added a more detailed support form to the Mintlify dashboard. You can now
submit a form to get in touch with us.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug for the Segment integration functionality.
- We now raise more granular error messages for GitHub permissions when
  interacting with the editor.
- Fixed bugs where the navigation would not properly expand when a direct link
  was used.
