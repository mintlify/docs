## Speed Performances

We made many updates to improve the overall speed for your OpenAPI pages and update workflows:

- For large projects (~3,000 files), the download step for docs updates is now ~440x faster - a 99.8% time reduction. Across the board, file downloads during updates are now ~5.5x faster - an 81.8% time reduction.

- For API reference pages with complex data types, we've drastically reduced the size of the page. For customers with complex, recursive OpenAPI data types, this means a size reduction of up to 98%.

## JWT Auth

For `Enterprise` customers, you can now use your own login flow to send user info to your docs via a JWT in the URL.
