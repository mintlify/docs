## Speed Performances

We made many updates to improve the overall speed for your OpenAPI pages and update workflows.

## Web Editor UI

We polished the UI with new icons and a new layout.

## File Uploads in API Playground

By default, API playground requests are proxied by Mintlify. Now you can use `disableProxy` to disable this behavior and support request types like file uploads.
