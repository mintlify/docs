## Code Line Highlighting

You can now highlight lines of code in your docs to emphasize and bring attention to important parts by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces `{}` and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```

```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```
````

## Light mode code blocks

Code blocks now have a light mode variant which can be enabled by adding the following to your `mint.json`:

```json
"code": {
  "mode": "auto"
}
```

## Advanced Footer

You can now add more links to the standard footer. This upgrade
provides more consistency between landing pages and docs, or greater customization
if you want to spotlight specific pages like socials or status logs.

## Filter search based on the current user

When user auth is enabled, search results are now filtered based on the current logged in user so that they only see the relevant content.
