  A good developer experience involves low latency and a snappy user experience. 

  For majority of our customers this was the case, but as we grew we noticed that some of our customers were really pushing our product to its edges in terms of scale. 

  This is why we decided to devote time to making sure customers of all sizes can experience speed.

  - For large projects (~3,000 files), the download step for docs updates is now ~440x faster - a 99.8% time reduction. Across the board, file downloads during updates are now ~5.5x faster - an 81.8% time reduction.
  - For API reference pages with complex data types, we have drastically reduced the size of the page. For customers with complex, recursive OpenAPI data types, this means a size reduction of up to 98%.
