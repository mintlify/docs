</Frame>
You can now ask AI to make changes to your docs, with the context of all existing documentation. Go into Web Editor, type in a prompt, and the assistant will propose changes by generating a pull request. 

## GitLab Integration Upgrade

We've improved our support for syncing with GitLab, such as enabling automated updates and preview deployments. Check out our [docs on GitLab](/settings/gitlab) to get started. 

## Web Editor
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/changelog/webeditor.jpg" alt="Web Editor" />

We've revamped our web editor so that you can now update docs with a fully WYSIWYG experience, while syncing with markdown.

## /llms.txt support
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/changelog/llms.jpg" alt="llms.txt support" />
</Frame>
All docs instances are now automatically hosted at /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt so that LLMs can easily ingest your documentation. For more information, read the [docs on the new llms.txt standard.](https://llmstxt.org)


## Localization
You can now localize your docs which operates similarly to versioning. Add a `locale` to a version and fixed content in Mintlify like "Was this page helpful?" will also match the locale.

## Code Line Highlighting

You can now highlight lines of code in your docs to emphasize and bring attention to important parts by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces `{}` and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```

````md
```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```
````

## Light mode code blocks

Code blocks now have a light mode variant which can be enabled by adding the following to your `mint.json`:

```json
"codeBlock": {
  "mode": "auto"
}
```

## Advanced Footer

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/changelog/advanced-footer.gif" alt="Advanced Footer" />

provides more consistency between landing pages and docs, or greater customization
if you want to spotlight specific pages like socials or status logs.
