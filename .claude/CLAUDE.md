# Mintlify documentation

## Working relationship
- You can push back on ideas-this can lead to better documentation. Cite sources and explain your reasoning when you do so
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information
- If you are making an inferrance, stop and ask me for confirmation or say that you need more information

## Project context
- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings
  - See the docs.json schema: https://mintlify.com/docs.json
- Components: Mintlify components

## Content strategy
- Document just enough for user success - not too much, not too little
- Prioritize accuracy and usability of information
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Search for existing information before adding new content. Avoid duplication unless it is done for a strategic reason
- Check existing patterns for consistency
- Start by making the smallest reasonable changes

## Frontmatter requirements for pages
- title: Clear, descriptive page title
- description: Concise summary for SEO/navigation

## Writing standards
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Prerequisites at start of procedural content
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Match style and formatting of existing pages
- Include both basic and advanced use cases
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Relative paths for internal links
- Use broadly applicable examples rather than overly specific business cases
- Lead with context when helpful - explain what something is before diving into implementation details
- Use sentence case for all headings ("Getting started", not "Getting Started")
- Use sentence case for code block titles ("Expandable example", not "Expandable Example")
- Prefer active voice and direct language
- Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
- Break complex instructions into clear numbered steps
- Make language more precise and contextual
- Use [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icon library

### Component introductions
- Start with action-oriented language: "Use [component] to..." rather than "The [component] component..."
- Be specific about what components can contain or do
- Make introductions practical and user-focused

### Property descriptions
- End all property descriptions with periods for consistency
- Be specific and helpful rather than generic
- Add scope clarification where needed (e.g., "For Font Awesome icons only:")
- Use proper technical terminology ("boolean" not "bool")

### Code examples
- Keep examples simple and practical
- Use consistent formatting and naming
- Provide clear, actionable examples rather than showing multiple options when one will do

## Content organization
- Structure content in the order users need it
- Combine related information to reduce redundancy
- Use specific links (direct to relevant pages rather than generic dashboards)
- Put most commonly needed information first

## Git workflow
- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Ask how to handle uncommitted changes before starting
- Create a new branch when no clear branch exists for changes
- Commit frequently throughout development
- NEVER skip or disable pre-commit hooks

## Do not
- Skip frontmatter on any MDX file
- Use absolute URLs for internal links
- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions - always ask for clarification
