## /llms.txt

The [/llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms.txt` file at the root that lists all available pages in your documentation. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find relevant content to user prompts.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt">Open llms.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## /llms-full.txt

The `/llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms-full.txt` file at the root.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms-full.txt">Open llms-full.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## Generating Markdown versions of pages

Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response times and lower token usage.

### .md extension

Add a `.md` to a page's URL to display a Markdown version of that page. 

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart.md">Open quickstart.md</PreviewButton>

### Command \+ C shortcut

Select Command \+ C (Ctrl \+ C on Windows) to copy any page as Markdown.
