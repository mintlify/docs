Mintlify generates optimized formats and provides shortcuts for integrating your documentation with LLMs and AI tools. These features help users get faster, more accurate responses when using your documentation as context for AI-powered workflows.

## Contextual menu

Provide quick access to AI-optimized content and direct integrations with popular AI tools from a contextual menu on your pages.

* **Copy page**: Copies the current page as Markdown for pasting as context into AI tools.
* **View as Markdown**: Opens the current page as Markdown.
* **Open in ChatGPT**: Creates a ChatGPT conversation with the current page as context.
* **Open in Claude**: Creates a Claude conversation with the current page as context.

### Enabling the contextual menu

Add the `contextual` field to your `docs.json` and specify which options you want to include in your menu.

```json
{
 "contextual": {
   "options": [
     "copy",
     "view",
     "chatgpt",
     "claude"
   ]
 }
}
```

## /llms.txt

The [/llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms.txt` file at the root that lists all available pages in your documentation. AI tools can use this file to understand your docmentation structure and find relevant content to user prompts.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt">Open llms.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## /llms-full.txt

The `/llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms-full.txt` file at the root.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms-full.txt">Open llms-full.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## Generating Markdown versions of pages

Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response times and lower token usage.

### .md extension

Add a `.md` to a page's URL to display a Markdown version of that page. 

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart.md">Open quickstart.md</PreviewButton>

### Command \+ C shortcut

Select Command \+ C (Ctrl \+ C on Windows) to copy any page as Markdown.
