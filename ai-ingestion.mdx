Mintlify generates optimized formats and provides shortcuts that help users get faster, more accurate responses when using your documentation as context for LLMs and AI tools.

## Contextual menu

Provide quick access to AI-optimized content and direct integrations with popular AI tools from a contextual menu on your pages.

* **Copy page**: Copies the current page as Markdown for pasting as context into AI tools.
* **View as Markdown**: Opens the current page as Markdown.
* **Open in ChatGPT**: Creates a ChatGPT conversation with the current page as context.
* **Open in Claude**: Creates a Claude conversation with the current page as context.

### Enabling the contextual menu

Add the `contextual` field to your `docs.json` and specify which options you want to include in your menu.

```json
{
 "contextual": {
   "options": [
     "copy",
     "view",
     "chatgpt",
     "claude"
   ]
 }
}
```

## /llms.txt

The [/llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms.txt` file at the root that lists all available pages in your documentation. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find relevant content to user prompts.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt">Open llms.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## /llms-full.txt

The `/llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms-full.txt` file at the root.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms-full.txt">Open llms-full.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## Generating Markdown versions of pages

Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response times and lower token usage.

### .md extension

Add a `.md` to a page's URL to display a Markdown version of that page. 

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart.md">Open quickstart.md</PreviewButton>

### Command \+ C shortcut

Select Command \+ C (Ctrl \+ C on Windows) to copy any page as Markdown.
