Mintlify generates optimized formats and provides shortcuts that help users get faster, more accurate responses when using your documentation as context for LLMs and AI tools.

## Contextual menu

Provide quick access to AI-optimized content and direct integrations with popular AI tools from a contextual menu on your pages.

* **Copy page**: Copies the current page as Markdown for pasting as context into AI tools.
* **View as Markdown**: Opens the current page as Markdown.
* **Open in ChatGPT**: Creates a ChatGPT conversation with the current page as context.
* **Open in Claude**: Creates a Claude conversation with the current page as context.

### Enabling the contextual menu

Add the `contextual` field to your `docs.json` and specify which options you want to include in your menu.

```json
{
 "contextual": {
   "options": [
     "copy",
     "view",
     "chatgpt",
     "claude"
   ]
 }
}
```

## PDF Reference Documents

Upload PDF documents to enhance your AI Assistant's knowledge base with custom reference materials. This feature allows your AI to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses by referencing your specific documentation and procedures.

### Benefits of PDF References

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: AI responses become more precise with access to your specific documentation
- **Custom Knowledge**: Include internal procedures, style guides, and technical specifications
- **Contextual Responses**: AI can reference relevant sections from your uploaded documents
- **Improved Productivity**: Reduce time spent searching for information across multiple sources

### Supported Document Types

Upload various types of reference materials to improve AI Assistant performance:

- Internal documentation and procedures
- Technical specifications and standards
- Style guides and writing standards
- Product documentation and user manuals
- API documentation and code examples

For detailed information on uploading and managing PDF reference documents, see our [Dashboard Settings documentation](/advanced/dashboard/settings).

## /llms.txt

The [/llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms.txt` file at the root that lists all available pages in your documentation. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find relevant content to user prompts.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt">Open llms.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## /llms-full.txt

The `/llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms-full.txt` file at the root.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms-full.txt">Open llms-full.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## Generating Markdown versions of pages

Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response times and lower token usage.

### .md extension

Add a `.md` to a page's URL to display a Markdown version of that page. 

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart.md">Open quickstart.md</PreviewButton>

### Command \+ C shortcut

Select Command \+ C (Ctrl \+ C on Windows) to copy any page as Markdown.
