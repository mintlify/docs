This page covers common issues you may encounter when setting up or maintaining your Mintlify documentation.

## Build and deployment issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My changes aren't appearing after deployment">
    1. **Check deployment status**: Visit the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to verify your deployment completed successfully.
    2. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows) or try incognito mode.
    3. **Verify file is in navigation**: Pages must be listed in `docs.json` navigation to be accessible.
    4. **Check for build errors**: Run `mintlify dev` locally to catch syntax or configuration errors before deploying.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build fails with validation errors">
    Common causes:
    - **Invalid JSON in docs.json**: Use a JSON validator to check for syntax errors like trailing commas or missing quotes.
    - **Missing required frontmatter**: Every MDX file needs at minimum a `title` field.
    - **Broken internal links**: Links to pages that don't exist will cause build warnings. Use relative paths without file extensions.
    
    Run `mintlify dev` locally to see detailed error messages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preview deployments not working">
    1. Ensure preview deployments are enabled in your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    2. Check that your GitHub/GitLab integration has the correct permissions.
    3. Verify the PR is targeting the correct branch configured in your dashboard.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content and formatting issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MDX components not rendering">
    - **Check component syntax**: Components are case-sensitive. Use `<Note>` not `<note>`.
    - **Close all tags**: Self-closing tags need a slash: `<br />` not `<br>`.
    - **Escape special characters**: Use `\{` to display literal curly braces in text.
    - **Check for JSX conflicts**: Angle brackets in code examples may need to be wrapped in backticks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code blocks not syntax highlighting">
    Ensure you specify the language after the opening backticks:
    
    ````md
    ```javascript
    const example = "highlighted";
    ```
    ````
    
    Supported languages include: `javascript`, `typescript`, `python`, `bash`, `json`, `yaml`, `mdx`, and [many more](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Images not displaying">
    1. **Check the path**: Use paths relative to your docs root, starting with `/`.
    2. **Verify file exists**: Ensure the image file is committed to your repository.
    3. **Check file format**: Supported formats include PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, and WebP.
    4. **File size**: Very large images may fail to load. Optimize images under 1MB.
    
    ```mdx
    ![Alt text](/images/my-image.png)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tables not rendering correctly">
    Ensure proper Markdown table syntax:
    - Header row must be followed by a separator row with dashes
    - Each row must have the same number of columns
    - Pipes must align (though this is optional)
    
    ```md
    | Header 1 | Header 2 |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Navigation issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Page not appearing in sidebar">
    1. **Add to navigation**: Pages must be listed in `docs.json` under `navigation`.
    2. **Check the path**: The path in navigation should match the file path without the `.mdx` extension.
    3. **Verify file location**: The MDX file must exist at the specified path.
    
    ```json
    "pages": ["folder/my-page"]  // matches folder/my-page.mdx
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Navigation order is wrong">
    Pages appear in the order listed in `docs.json`. Reorder the entries in your navigation array to change the display order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Broken links showing 404">
    1. **Use relative paths**: Link to `/page-name` not `https://yourdocs.com/page-name`.
    2. **Omit file extensions**: Use `/guides/quickstart` not `/guides/quickstart.mdx`.
    3. **Check case sensitivity**: Paths are case-sensitive on most systems.
    4. **Add redirects**: If you've moved a page, add a redirect in `docs.json`:
    
    ```json
    "redirects": [
      { "source": "/old-path", "destination": "/new-path" }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Custom domain issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not working">
    1. **Verify DNS settings**: Check that your CNAME record points to `cname.mintlify.com`.
    2. **Wait for propagation**: DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate.
    3. **Check SSL certificate**: Mintlify automatically provisions SSL, but this can take a few minutes after DNS propagation.
    4. **Verify in dashboard**: Ensure the custom domain is correctly configured in your Mintlify dashboard.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL certificate errors">
    SSL certificates are automatically provisioned. If you see certificate errors:
    1. Wait 10-15 minutes after DNS propagation for certificate provisioning.
    2. Clear your browser's SSL cache or try a different browser.
    3. Verify your DNS is correctly pointing to Mintlify's servers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Local development issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="mintlify dev command not found">
    Install the Mintlify CLI globally:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g mintlify
    ```
    
    Or use npx to run without installing:
    
    ```bash
    npx mintlify dev
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local preview shows old content">
    1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
    2. Clear the `.mintlify` cache folder in your project
    3. Restart with `mintlify dev`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    The default port is 3000. If it's in use, specify a different port:
    
    ```bash
    mintlify dev --port 3001
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
