description: Common issues and solutions for Mintlify documentation

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when working with Mintlify and how to resolve them.

## Build errors

### Syntax errors in MDX files

**Problem**: Build fails with parsing errors.

**Solution**: Check your MDX files for:
- Unclosed JSX tags
- Missing closing braces in component props
- Invalid frontmatter YAML syntax
- Special characters that need escaping

Run `mintlify dev` locally to identify the specific file and line causing the error.

### Missing or invalid frontmatter

**Problem**: Pages don't display correctly or build fails.

**Solution**: Ensure every MDX file has valid frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Your page title
description: A brief description
---
```

Both `title` and `description` are required fields.

### Navigation configuration errors

**Problem**: Build fails with navigation-related errors.

**Solution**: Verify your `docs.json` navigation structure:
- All page paths reference existing MDX files
- No duplicate page entries
- Proper JSON syntax (commas, brackets, quotes)
- Valid icon names from the Lucide library

## Preview issues

### Local preview not updating

**Problem**: Changes don't appear in `mintlify dev`.

**Solution**:
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Restart with `mintlify dev`
4. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Images not loading

**Problem**: Images show broken or don't display.

**Solution**:
- Verify image paths are relative to the MDX file
- Check that images exist in your repository
- Ensure image files are committed to Git
- Use supported formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF, WebP)
- Check file names don't contain spaces or special characters

### Components not rendering

**Problem**: Mintlify components display as plain text or don't work.

**Solution**:
- Verify component syntax matches documentation
- Check for typos in component names (case-sensitive)
- Ensure props are properly formatted
- Close all component tags properly

## Deployment issues

### Build succeeds locally but fails in production

**Problem**: `mintlify dev` works but deployment fails.

**Solution**:
- Check for environment-specific file paths
- Verify all files are committed and pushed to Git
- Review deployment logs for specific error messages
- Ensure `docs.json` is valid JSON (use a JSON validator)

### Changes not appearing after deployment

**Problem**: Deployed site doesn't reflect recent changes.

**Solution**:
1. Verify changes are pushed to the correct branch
2. Check deployment status in your Mintlify dashboard
3. Clear CDN cache if using custom domain
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for propagation
5. Hard refresh your browser

### Custom domain not working

**Problem**: Custom domain shows errors or doesn't connect.

**Solution**:
- Verify DNS records are correctly configured
- Allow 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Check that CNAME points to your Mintlify subdomain
- Ensure SSL certificate has been issued (can take up to 24 hours)

## Search issues

### Search not finding pages

**Problem**: Search doesn't return expected results.

**Solution**:
- Ensure pages are included in navigation (hidden pages aren't indexed)
- Add descriptive `title` and `description` in frontmatter
- Include relevant keywords in page content
- Wait for search index to rebuild after deployment (5-10 minutes)

### Search showing outdated content

**Problem**: Search results show old content.

**Solution**:
- Redeploy your documentation to trigger reindexing
- Clear browser cache
- Wait 10-15 minutes for search index to update

## API documentation issues

### OpenAPI spec not loading

**Problem**: API reference pages don't generate or show errors.

**Solution**:
- Validate your OpenAPI spec using [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
- Ensure the spec file path in `docs.json` is correct
- Check that the spec is valid JSON or YAML
- Verify the spec version is supported (OpenAPI 3.0+)

### API playground not working

**Problem**: Try it out feature doesn't work.

**Solution**:
- Check CORS configuration on your API server
- Verify authentication setup in `docs.json`
- Ensure API endpoints are accessible
- Check browser console for error messages

## Authentication issues

### Users can't access protected docs

**Problem**: Authentication fails or loops.

**Solution**:
- Verify JWT configuration in `docs.json`
- Check token expiration settings
- Ensure authentication endpoint is accessible
- Review authentication logs in dashboard
- Test with a fresh browser session (incognito mode)

## Performance issues

### Slow page loads

**Problem**: Documentation loads slowly.

**Solution**:
- Optimize image sizes (use WebP format, compress images)
- Reduce number of custom scripts
- Minimize use of large embedded content
- Consider lazy loading for heavy components

### Build takes too long

**Problem**: Deployment builds are slow.

**Solution**:
- Reduce number of pages if possible
- Optimize image assets
- Remove unused files from repository
- Check for circular dependencies in snippets

## Git integration issues

### GitHub/GitLab connection fails

**Problem**: Can't connect repository or deployments don't trigger.

**Solution**:
- Verify repository permissions (Mintlify needs read access)
- Check that webhook is properly configured
- Ensure branch name matches configuration
- Re-authenticate Git integration in dashboard

### Merge conflicts in docs.json

**Problem**: Navigation changes cause merge conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Pull latest changes before editing navigation
- Use web editor for navigation changes when possible
- Coordinate with team on navigation updates
- Keep navigation changes in separate commits
