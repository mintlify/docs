The Workflows dashboard provides observability and control for automated documentation workflows. Use workflows to keep your documentation in sync with your codebase through scheduled updates or triggered by code changes.

## What are workflows?

Workflows are automated processes that run the agent to update your documentation based on triggers like PR merges or scheduled intervals. Unlike using the agent directly in your dashboard or Slack, workflows run automatically without manual intervention.

### Workflows vs. agent workflows

The term "workflows" refers to two different concepts in Mintlify:

- **Workflows** (this page): Automated processes configured in `.mintlify/workflows/` files that run on triggers like PR merges or schedules. You monitor and manage these in the Workflows dashboard.
- **[Agent workflows](/agent/workflows)**: Examples and patterns for using the agent in your documentation process, such as iterating in Slack threads or generating code examples.

This page documents the Workflows dashboard for monitoring automated workflows.

## Access the Workflows dashboard

To view your workflows:

1. Open your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Products** → **Workflows** in the sidebar.

If you don't see the Workflows option, contact your Mintlify account team to enable this feature.

## Workflows overview page

The overview page displays all workflows configured in your documentation repository. Each workflow card shows:

- **Workflow name**: The name defined in your workflow configuration file.
- **File path**: Location of the workflow configuration file (e.g., `sync-api-docs.yml`).
- **Trigger badges**: How the workflow is triggered:
  - **PR merges**: Runs when pull requests are merged to specified branches.
  - **Schedule**: Runs on a cron schedule.
  - **Hourly/Daily/Weekly**: Frequency for scheduled workflows.
- **Automerge badge**: Indicates if the workflow automatically merges pull requests when successful.
- **Status badge**: Shows if the workflow is active or deleted.
- **Instructions preview**: First few lines of the workflow's prompt.
- **Last run timestamp**: When the workflow last executed, or creation date if never run.

### Empty state

If you haven't configured any workflows yet, you'll see an empty state with a **Get started** button that links to the workflows documentation.

## Workflow details page

Click any workflow card to view detailed information and run history.

### Workflow information

The detail page header shows:

- **Workflow name and status**: Name with status badge (active or deleted).
- **Trigger configuration**: Badges showing how the workflow is triggered.
- **Automerge setting**: Whether pull requests are automatically merged.
- **File path**: Location of the workflow configuration file.
- **Instructions**: The full prompt that guides the agent's updates.

### Manual trigger

Click **Trigger manually** to run the workflow immediately. This button is:

- Disabled when the workflow has active runs (queued or running status).
- Hidden for deleted workflows.

Use manual triggers to test workflows or run updates outside the normal schedule.

### Run history

The run history table displays all workflow executions with the following columns:

#### Started

The timestamp when the workflow run began. Displays in your local timezone with format: `Mon DD, HH:MM AM/PM`.

#### Ended

The timestamp when the workflow completed or failed. Shows:

- Timestamp for completed or failed runs.
- `—` for queued or running workflows.

#### Status

The current state of the workflow run:

- **Queued** (yellow badge): Workflow is waiting to start.
- **Running** (blue badge): Workflow is currently executing.
- **Success** (green badge): Workflow completed successfully.
- **Failed** (red badge): Workflow encountered an error. Hover over the badge to see the error message.

#### Pull request

Link to the pull request created by the workflow. Shows:

- `PR #123` link for workflows that create pull requests.
- `—` for workflows with automerge enabled (no PR created).

Click the link to view the pull request on GitHub.

#### Message

Additional information about the run:

- Error messages for failed runs.
- Empty for successful runs.

### Pagination

The run history loads 20 runs at a time. Click **Load more** at the bottom to view older runs.

### Auto-refresh

The run history automatically refreshes:

- Every 5 seconds when any runs are queued or running.
- Every 2 minutes when all runs are completed or failed.

This ensures you see real-time status updates without manually refreshing the page.

## Workflow metadata

### Triggers

Workflows support two trigger types:

#### PR merges

Runs when pull requests are merged to specified branches in connected repositories. The workflow configuration specifies:

- Repository name (e.g., `org/repo`).
- Branch name (e.g., `main`).

Multiple repositories and branches can trigger the same workflow.

#### Scheduled

Runs on a cron schedule. Common patterns include:

- **Hourly**: `0 * * * *` or `*/60 * * * *`
- **Daily**: `0 9 * * *` (9 AM daily)
- **Weekly**: `0 9 * * 1` (9 AM every Monday)

The schedule badge shows the frequency (Hourly, Daily, or Weekly) when detected.

### Automerge

When enabled, the workflow automatically merges pull requests that pass all checks. This is useful for:

- High-confidence automated updates.
- Workflows that run frequently with small changes.
- Reducing manual review overhead.

Workflows without automerge create pull requests for manual review before merging.

### Run timestamps

All timestamps display in your local timezone. The system tracks:

- **Created at**: When the workflow was first configured.
- **Last ran at**: Most recent execution time.
- **Started**: When each run began.
- **Ended**: When each run completed or failed.

## Workflow statuses

### Active

The workflow is enabled and will run according to its trigger configuration. Active workflows:

- Execute on schedule or when triggered by PR merges.
- Can be manually triggered from the dashboard.
- Create pull requests in your documentation repository.

### Deleted

The workflow configuration file was removed from your repository. Deleted workflows:

- No longer execute on triggers.
- Cannot be manually triggered.
- Remain visible in the dashboard with historical run data.
- Show a red "Deleted" badge.

To reactivate a deleted workflow, restore the configuration file in your repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not appearing

- Verify the workflow configuration file exists in `.mintlify/workflows/`.
- Check that the file has a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension.
- Ensure your documentation repository is connected to Mintlify.
- Confirm the Workflows feature is enabled for your organization.

### Runs stuck in queued status

- Check the [status page](https://status.mintlify.com) for service issues.
- Verify your organization has available workflow execution capacity.
- Contact support if runs remain queued for more than 10 minutes.

### Failed runs

Hover over the failed status badge to see the error message. Common issues include:

- **Permission errors**: Verify the Mintlify app has write access to your documentation repository.
- **Invalid configuration**: Check the workflow configuration file for syntax errors.
- **API errors**: Ensure connected repositories are accessible.

### Manual trigger disabled

The manual trigger button is disabled when:

- The workflow has runs in queued or running status.
- The workflow is deleted.

Wait for active runs to complete before triggering manually.
