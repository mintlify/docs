The [analytics](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/analytics/v2/) page in your dashboard shows data about visitors to your docs, how they interact with the assistant, what they search for, and their feedback. Use this information to identify which pages are most valuable to your users and track trends over time.

Use the range selector to adjust the time period for displayed data.

## Traffic source filter

Use the traffic source filter to toggle between different types of visitors:

- **All Traffic**: View combined analytics for both AI agents and human visitors
- **AI**: View analytics specifically for AI agent traffic (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
- **Human**: View analytics for human visitors only

<Note>
  When viewing AI traffic, certain metrics (Assistant, Searches, Feedback) are hidden as they only apply to human visitors. AI traffic shows AI-specific metrics like MCP Searches and Top Agents instead.

## Visitors

The visitors tab displays a bar chart of visitors over time, a list of popular pages, and referrers or top agents depending on your traffic source filter.

Review your visitors analytics to:

- **Monitor traffic trends**: Observe changes in traffic after updates or new content to understand the impact of your changes.
- **Identify popular pages**: Use popular pages to understand what content is most important to your users so that you can make sure it is up to date and comprehensive.
- **Track traffic sources**: Understand where your users are coming from to help you optimize your content for the right audience.
- **Analyze AI agent traffic**: When viewing AI traffic, see which AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) are visiting your documentation in the Top Agents table.

### Top Agents

When viewing AI traffic, the Top Agents table replaces the referrals table and shows which AI agents are accessing your documentation.

Use the Top Agents table to:

- **Understand AI adoption**: See which AI platforms are integrating with your documentation
- **Track AI engagement**: Monitor visit counts from different AI agents over time
- **Optimize for AI**: Identify which AI agents are most active to prioritize optimization efforts

## Assistant

The assistant tab displays a bar chart of assistant usage over time, a list of categories, and chat history.

Review your assistant analytics to:

- **Monitor assistant usage**: Observe changes in assistant usage to understand how your users engage with your content.
- **Identify frequent categories**: Use high occurrence categories to understand what topics are most important to your users. Identify gaps in coverage and prioritize content updates.
- **Review chat history**: Get detailed high intent data about how your users think about your product by reviewing their chat history with the assistant. See what terms they use, what they need help with, and what tasks they try to accomplish.

### Categories

The categories tab uses LLMs to automatically group conversations by topic or theme.

Use categories to identify common topics, patterns in user needs and behavior, and areas where documentation might need expansion or clarification.

Click a category row to expand it and view related conversations grouped under that category.

Click an individual conversation to view the complete chat thread, including the user's question, the assistant's response, and any sources cited.

### Chat history

The chat history tab displays chronological records of all assistant conversations.

Click any message to view the complete chat thread, including the user's question, the assistant's response, and any sources cited.

### Export queries

For deeper analysis, export a CSV file of your queries, responses, and sources. Use your preferred tools to analyze the exported data.

<Tip>
  Sample analysis prompts:

  - List any queries that had no sources cited.
  - Find patterns in unsuccessful interactions.
</Tip>

## Searches

The searches tab displays a bar chart of searches over time and specific queries.

Review your searches analytics to:

- **Monitor search trends**: Observe changes in search queries to understand how your users are finding your content and what topics they want information on.
- **Identify frequent queries**: Use frequent queries to understand what topics are most important to your users. Identify gaps in coverage and prioritize content updates.
- **Identify low click through rates**: Click through rates (CTR) show how many users click a search result after typing in a query. Low CTR can indicate that the search results are not relevant to users' queries. If you have frequent search terms with low CTR, consider improving the relevance of search results by adding keywords and updating your content.

## Feedback

The feedback tab displays a bar chart of feedback over time and specific feedback items.

See [Feedback](/optimize/feedback) for more information on using feedback data to improve your content.
