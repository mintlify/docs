<Info>
  To collect and view feedback, you must enable feedback from the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page in your dashboard.
</Info>

The [feedback](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/analytics/v2/feedback) tab displays quantitative thumbs up and thumbs down votes your docs have received and any qualitative feedback that users have provided. Use this information to gauge the quality of your docs and make improvements.

View feedback on the analytics page in your dashboard.

- **Thumbs rating**: Simple thumbs up/down voting to gauge overall satisfaction with pages.
- **Contextual feedback**: Free form feedback about the content of a page. Optionally [collect user email addresses](#email-collection) with feedback submissions.
- **Code snippet feedback**: Feedback specifically on code snippets.
- **Edit suggestions**: Allow users to suggest edits to your documentation. Only available for public GitHub repositories.
- **Raise issues**: Allow users to create GitHub issues directly from your documentation. Only available for public GitHub repositories.

<Note>
  If you disable telemetry in your `docs.json` file, feedback features are not available on your documentation pages.
</Note>

## Email collection

When contextual feedback is enabled, you can optionally allow users to provide their email address when submitting feedback. This makes it possible to follow up with users about their feedback.

To enable email collection for contextual feedback, go to the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page in your dashboard and enable the email field option.

You can also add a custom disclaimer message that appears next to the email field. Use this to explain how you will use the email address, such as for follow-up questions about the feedback.

## Manage feedback

For contextual and code snippet feedback, you can set the status of a piece of feedback and add internal notes to track your work resolving user feedback.

### Change feedback status

Select the status beside a piece of feedback to mark it as **Pending**, **In Progress**, **Resolved**, or **Dismissed**.

Best practices for setting feedback statuses:

- **Pending**: Feedback is awaiting review.
- **In Progress**: Feedback has been validated and is being worked on.
- **Resolved**: Feedback has been resolved.
- **Dismissed**: Feedback has been dismissed as not actionable, irrelevant, or inaccurate.

### Filter by status

Use the status filter to control which feedback is displayed. Clear a status to hide all feedback with that status. By default, all feedback is displayed.

### Add internal notes

Click a piece of feedback to add an internal note. These notes are only visible to people with access to your dashboard.

Use notes to add information for collaboration, link relevant support or engineering tickets, or remember any other useful information.

## Use feedback data

Review your feedback data to:

- **Identify successful content**: Pages with the most positive feedback show what works well in your documentation.
- **Prioritize improvements**: Pages with the most negative feedback indicate what content might need attention.
- **Take action**: Make documentation updates based on direct user feedback.
