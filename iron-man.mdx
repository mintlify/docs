## Overview

Iron Man (2008) is a superhero film directed by Jon Favreau that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film follows billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark on his journey from war profiteer to armored hero.

## Plot summary

### Capture in Afghanistan

Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries, travels to Afghanistan to demonstrate his company's new Jericho missile system. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed by the terrorist group Ten Rings. Stark is critically wounded by shrapnel lodged near his heart and captured.

### The cave

Fellow captive Ho Yinsen saves Stark's life by implanting an electromagnet in his chest to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heart. The Ten Rings demand that Stark build them a Jericho missile, but instead he and Yinsen secretly construct a miniaturized arc reactor to power Stark's chest piece and a powered suit of armor to escape. During the breakout, Yinsen sacrifices himself to buy Stark time. Stark destroys the terrorists' weapons cache and escapes.

### Return and revelation

After being rescued by the U.S. military and his friend James Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. This decision puts him at odds with his business partner Obadiah Stane.

### Building the Mark II and III

Working in secret, Stark builds an improved suit of armor (Mark II and then Mark III) in his workshop. He refines the flight systems, weapons, and his AI assistant J.A.R.V.I.S. to help operate the suit.

### Fighting the Ten Rings

Stark learns that the Ten Rings has been using Stark Industries weapons to terrorize a village called Gulmira (Yinsen's home). He flies there in his new suit and defeats the terrorists, then evades the U.S. Air Force on his return.

### Stane's betrayal

Obadiah Stane reveals he arranged Stark's assassination in Afghanistan to take control of the company. Stane steals Stark's arc reactor prototype and builds his own larger suit, the Iron Monger. He temporarily paralyzes Stark and takes the arc reactor from his chest.

### Final battle

Stark retrieves his original arc reactor and confronts Stane on the roof of Stark Industries. During the battle, Stark instructs Pepper Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. The resulting blast defeats Stane. 

### "I am Iron Man"

At a press conference the next day, Stark ignores the prepared cover story and publicly declares, "I am Iron Man."
