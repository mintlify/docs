## Overview

Iron Man (2008) is a superhero film directed by Jon Favreau that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film follows billionaire industrialist Tony Stark as he transforms from a weapons manufacturer into a superhero.

## Plot summary

### The abduction

Tony Stark, genius inventor and CEO of Stark Industries, travels to Afghanistan to demonstrate his company's new Jericho missile to the U.S. military. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed by terrorists called the Ten Rings. Stark is critically wounded by shrapnel near his heart and captured.

### Captivity and escape

In captivity, fellow prisoner Yinsen implants an electromagnet in Stark's chest to prevent the shrapnel from reaching his heart. The Ten Rings orders Stark to build them a Jericho missile, but instead, he secretly constructs a miniaturized arc reactor to power his chest piece and a prototype armored suit.

Stark and Yinsen use the suit to escape. Yinsen sacrifices himself to buy Stark time. Stark destroys the Ten Rings' weapons cache and flies to safety, though the suit is destroyed upon landing. He is rescued by the U.S. military and returns home.

### A new direction

Back in the United States, Stark announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons, shocking his business partner Obadiah Stane. Stark secretly begins building an improved suit of armor in his workshop, powered by a new, more powerful arc reactor.

He develops the Mark II and then the Mark III suit, adding weapons systems and flight capabilities. When Stark discovers that Stane has been dealing weapons to the Ten Rings behind his back, he flies to Afghanistan in his new suit and destroys their weapons stockpile, saving the village of Gulmira.

### The final battle

Stane has the remains of Stark's original suit recovered from Afghanistan and uses it to create his own larger suit, the Iron Monger. He steals the arc reactor from Stark's chest, leaving him for dead. Stark manages to reach his original, less powerful arc reactor and survives.

The two face off in a climactic battle over Los Angeles. With help from his assistant Pepper Potts, Stark defeats Stane by overloading the large arc reactor at Stark Industries, which explodes and kills Stane.

### The reveal

At a press conference the next day, Stark is given an alibi and cover story by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson. However, Stark deviates from the script and announces to the world: "I am Iron Man."

In a post-credits scene, Nick Fury approaches Stark about the "Avenger Initiative," setting up future Marvel films.
