## Overview

Iron Man (2008) is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, directed by Jon Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.

## Plot summary

### The ambush

Tony Stark, a billionaire weapons manufacturer and genius inventor, travels to Afghanistan to demonstrate the Jericho missile system to the U.S. military. After the demonstration, his convoy is attacked by the Ten Rings terrorist organization using Stark Industries weapons. Tony is severely wounded by shrapnel near his heart and captured.

### Captivity and the first suit

In captivity, fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen implants an electromagnet in Tony's chest to keep the shrapnel from reaching his heart. The Ten Rings demand that Tony build them a Jericho missile, but instead he and Yinsen secretly construct a miniaturized arc reactor to power Tony's chest piece and a crude suit of armor. Tony uses the armor to escape, though Yinsen sacrifices himself to buy Tony time.

### Return and transformation

After being rescued in the desert, Tony returns home and announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons. He builds an improved arc reactor and begins developing a more advanced suit of armor in his workshop. His business partner Obadiah Stane is troubled by Tony's new direction.

### Becoming Iron Man

Tony perfects his Mark II and Mark III suits, gaining the ability to fly and adding advanced weapons systems. He uses the suit to destroy Stark Industries weapons that have fallen into terrorist hands in the Middle East, attracting attention from the military and the press, who dub the mysterious figure "Iron Man."

### Betrayal revealed

Tony discovers that Obadiah Stane has been secretly selling weapons to terrorists and was responsible for ordering the hit on Tony in Afghanistan. Stane has the Ten Rings recover Tony's original armor from the desert and uses it to build his own larger suit, the Iron Monger.

### The final battle

Stane paralyzes Tony and steals his arc reactor, leaving him to die. Tony reaches his original prototype reactor just in time. Stane, in the Iron Monger suit, attacks and the two battle at Stark Industries. With Pepper Potts' help, Tony overloads the building's large arc reactor, creating a surge that defeats Stane.

### The reveal

At a press conference the next day, Tony is given an alibi by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, but instead of using it, Tony declares to the world: "I am Iron Man."

## Post-credits scene

Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., visits Tony at his home to discuss the "Avenger Initiative," setting up future films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
