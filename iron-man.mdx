## Overview

Iron Man (2008) is the film that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Jon Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr., the movie tells the origin story of Tony Stark's transformation from billionaire weapons manufacturer to armored superhero.

## Plot summary

### Capture in Afghanistan

Tony Stark, genius inventor and CEO of Stark Industries, travels to Afghanistan to demonstrate the company's new Jericho missile system. After the demonstration, his military convoy is ambushed by the terrorist group Ten Rings. Stark is critically wounded by shrapnel near his heart and taken captive.

### The cave

Fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen, a skilled doctor, implants an electromagnet in Stark's chest to prevent the shrapnel from reaching his heart. The Ten Rings leader, Raza, demands that Stark build a Jericho missile for them. Instead, Stark and Yinsen secretly construct a miniaturized arc reactor to power Stark's chest piece and a crude but powerful suit of armor.

### Escape

Using the armor, Stark fights his way out of the cave. Yinsen sacrifices himself to buy Stark time, urging him not to waste his life. Stark escapes into the desert and is eventually rescued by his friend, Colonel James Rhodes.

### Return and revelation

Back in the United States, Stark announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons, shocking the business world and his partner Obadiah Stane. Stark secretly begins building an improved suit of armor in his home workshop, creating the iconic red and gold Mark III suit.

### Betrayal

Stark discovers that Stane has been dealing weapons to the Ten Rings behind his back. Stane paralyzes Stark and steals the arc reactor from his chest. Stark barely survives by using his original prototype reactor.

### Final battle

Stane builds his own armored suit, the Iron Monger, using the recovered Mark I armor from Afghanistan. The two face off in a battle over Stark Industries. With assistance from his assistant Pepper Potts, Stark defeats Stane by overloading the large arc reactor at the facility.

### "I am Iron Man"

At a press conference the following day, Stark ignores the cover story prepared for him and announces to the world: "I am Iron Man." This moment sets the tone for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe that would follow.
