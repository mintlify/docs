## Rate limits

The agent API has the following limits:

- 10,000 uses per key per month
- 10,000 requests per Mintlify organization per hour
- 10,000 requests per IP per day

## Usage

This endpoint creates an AI writer job that can generate and edit documentation based on provided messages and branch information. The job executes asynchronously and returns a streaming response with the execution details and results.

## Branch Management

The agent requires branch information to know where to make changes:
- `branchName`: The target git branch for documentation changes
- `branchExists`: Whether the branch already exists in your repository

If the branch doesn't exist, the agent will create it. If files are edited successfully, a draft pull request will be automatically created.
