openapi: POST /agent/job/{domain}
---

This endpoint creates an agent job based on provided messages and branch information. The job executes asynchronously and returns a streaming response with the execution details and results.

If a branch doesn't exist, the agent creates one. If files are edited successfully, a draft pull request is automatically created at the end of the job.

## Suggested usage

For best results, use the useChat hook from ai-sdk to send requests and handle responses.
