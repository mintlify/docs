openapi: POST /agent/job/{domain}
---

This endpoint creates an AI writer job that can generate and edit documentation based on provided messages and branch information. The job executes asynchronously and returns a streaming response with the execution details and results.
If the branch doesn't exist, the agent will create it. If files are edited successfully, a draft pull request will be automatically created at the end of the job

## Suggested usage

For best results, use the useChat hook from ai-sdk to send requests and handle responses.
