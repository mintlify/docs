openapi: POST /agent/job/{domain}
---

This endpoint creates an agent job based on provided messages and branch information. The job executes asynchronously and returns a streaming response with the execution details and results.

If a branch doesn't exist, the agent creates one. If files are edited successfully, a draft pull request is automatically created at the end of the job.

## Rate limits

The agent API has the following limits:

- 10,000 uses per key per month
- 10,000 requests per Mintlify organization per hour
- 10,000 requests per IP per day

## Suggested usage

For best results, use the [useChat hook from ai-sdk](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat#usechat) to send requests and handle responses.
