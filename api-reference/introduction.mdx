## Authentication

You can generate an API key through [the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is associated with an entire organization and can be used across multiple deployments.

## Admin API key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API. It is used to trigger updates via the [Update endpoint](/api-reference/update/trigger).

## Assistant API key

The assistant API allows you to embed the AI assistant, trained on your docs and continually kept up to date, into any application of your choosing.

Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right destinations for more information.

<Note>
  The assistant API **token** is a public token that can be referenced in your frontend code. The API **key** is a server-side token that should be kept secret.
  
  Calls using the assistant API token can incur costs: either using your AI chat credits or incurring overages.
