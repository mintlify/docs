The Mintlify REST API enables you to programmatically interact with your documentation, trigger updates, and embed AI-powered chat experiences.

## Endpoints

- [Trigger Update](/api-reference/update/trigger): Trigger an update of your site when desired.
- [Get Update Status](/api-reference/update/status): Get the status of an update and other details about your docs.
- [Generate Assistant Message](/api-reference/chat/create-assistant-message): Embed the assistant, trained on your docs, into any application of your choosing.

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through [the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). API keys are associated with an entire organization and can be used across multiple deployments.

### Admin API key

The admin API key is used for the majority of the API. It is used to trigger updates and get update status.

Admin API keys begin with the `mint_` prefix. Keep your admin API keys secret.

### Assistant API key

The assistant API key is used for generating assistant chat messages through the API. Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right destinations for more information.

Assistant API keys begin with the `mint_dsc_` prefix.

The assistant API **key** is a server-side token that should be kept secret.

The assistant API **token** is a public token that can be referenced in your frontend code.

<Note>
  Calls using the assistant API token can incur costs: either using your AI chat credits or incurring overages.
