<Note>Entities are getting a large overhaul early April 2025 to support more dynamic options.</Note>

## What are entities?

Entities are the traffic targets for configuration in Repacket. They let you define what properties we should match against to enforce your rule. 

## Entity types

Today, Repacket allows you to configure custom categories and IP ranges.

### Categories

Categories represent a group of domains. These can include wildcards, *and often should*.

Repacket ships with nearly [80 default categories](/config/categories).

### IP Ranges

IP ranges allow you to target traffic based on the destination IP address.

These use CIDR notation and are generally used to exclude your internal websites from Repacket features.
