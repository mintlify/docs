## What are modules?

Modules are the core features of Repacket, each designed to provide targeted protection and control over network traffic. Modules interact with Entities such as categories, domains, 
IP ranges, and applications enabling precise policy enforcement to defend against a variety of threats.

Modules generally use a "rule builder" system, which you will see referenced through the rest of our pages.

## Module Types

### Firewall

Firewall allows you to configure Repacket for content filtering, as well as use us as a generic web firewall.

You can use this to block entire categories, specific websites, or direct users about company-approved alternatives.

Read more on our [Firewall docs](/modules/firewall) or [visit your Firewall config](https://app.repacket.com/gateway#firewall).

### Protections

Protections allow you to apply enhanced security controls on top of specific forms of traffic.

You can use this to run advanced phishing protection scripts on Uncategorized websites for example - a common Repacket use-case.

Read more on our [Protections docs](/modules/protections) or [visit your Protections config](https://app.repacket.com/gateway#protections).


### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Our DLP allows you to analyze uploads and website submissions for sensitive data, like PHI, PII, Corporate Contracts, and more.

Today this is targeted at LLMs, but can technically be applied on most websites or apps. We also support Slack.

For example, Repacket can detect PHI being uploaded to ChatGPT, and warn users in advance.
