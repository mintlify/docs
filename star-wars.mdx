The Star Wars saga follows the epic struggle between the dark side and the light side of the Force across multiple generations.

## The original trilogy (Episodes IV-VI)

Luke Skywalker, a young farm boy on Tatooine, discovers he is the son of a Jedi Knight and joins the Rebel Alliance to fight the tyrannical Galactic Empire. Guided by Obi-Wan Kenobi and later Yoda, Luke trains to become a Jedi while his friends Han Solo and Princess Leia lead the rebellion.

The trilogy culminates with Luke confronting Darth Vader, revealed to be his father Anakin Skywalker, and the Emperor. Vader ultimately redeems himself by saving Luke and destroying the Emperor, restoring balance to the Force.

## The prequel trilogy (Episodes I-III)

Set decades earlier, these films chronicle the fall of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Empire. Young Anakin Skywalker is discovered as a powerful Force-sensitive child and trained as a Jedi by Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Manipulated by Senator Palpatine (secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious), Anakin falls to the dark side, becomes Darth Vader, and helps destroy the Jedi Order. The Republic transforms into the Empire, and Anakin's children Luke and Leia are hidden away.

## The sequel trilogy (Episodes VII-IX)

A generation after the Empire's fall, the First Order rises from its ashes. Rey, a scavenger from Jakku, discovers her Force abilities and trains under Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.

Rey faces Kylo Ren (Ben Solo, son of Han and Leia), who has turned to the dark side. The trilogy concludes with Rey defeating the resurrected Emperor Palpatine with help from all past Jedi, while Ben Solo sacrifices himself after returning to the light.
