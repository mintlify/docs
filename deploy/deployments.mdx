Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub app is installed on the account or organization that owns your docs repository. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/deploy/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If the GitHub app is connected, but changes are still not deploying, you can manually trigger a rebuild from your dashboard.

## Manually triggering a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your latest commit was successful.">
    Check that your latest commit appears in your docs repository and did not encounter any errors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually trigger a deployment.">
    Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and select the deploy button.

## Deleting a deployment

You can permanently delete a deployment from your organization settings. This action is irreversible and will remove all associated data, including preview deployments.

<Warning>
  Deleting a deployment is permanent and cannot be undone. All deployment data, preview deployments, and configuration will be permanently removed.
</Warning>

### Requirements

- You must have the `deployment.delete` permission (Admin role)
- If you have an active subscription, it will be cancelled and you'll receive a prorated credit for any unused time

### How to delete a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to organization settings">
    Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Danger zone**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide a deletion reason">
    In the "Delete my deployment" section, enter a reason for deleting the deployment. This helps us improve our product.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Click **Delete [deployment name]** and confirm the action in the modal that appears.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What happens after deletion

- If you have other deployments in your organization, you'll be redirected to the next available deployment
- If this is your only deployment, you'll be redirected to the Mintlify homepage
- All preview deployments associated with this deployment will be deleted
- Any active subscription will be cancelled with a prorated refund

<Note>
  Deleting a deployment is different from deleting your entire organization. To delete your organization and all its deployments, use the "Delete my organization" option in the same Danger zone settings page.
