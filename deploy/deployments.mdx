Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub account or organization that owns your docs repository has the GitHub App installed. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/deploy/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If you have the GitHub App installed, but changes are still not deploying, manually trigger a deployment from your dashboard.

## Manually trigger a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your latest commit was successful.">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually trigger a deployment.">

## Delete a deployment

You can permanently delete a deployment from the [Danger zone](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/danger-zone) in your dashboard settings. This action is irreversible and removes all deployment data, including any associated preview deployments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Danger zone.">
    Go to the [Danger zone](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/danger-zone) in the settings page of your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete the deployment.">
    1. In the **Delete my deployment** section, provide a reason for deletion.
    2. Click the delete button and confirm that you want to delete the deployment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Deleting a deployment is permanent and cannot be undone. If you have an active subscription, you'll receive a prorated credit for any unused time remaining in your billing period.
</Warning>

If you have multiple deployments, you'll be redirected to another deployment after deletion. If you delete your only deployment, you'll be redirected to the Mintlify homepage. When you delete a deployment, the organization admin receives an email notification confirming the deletion.
