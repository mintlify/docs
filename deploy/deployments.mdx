Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub app is installed on the account or organization that owns your docs repository. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/deploy/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If the GitHub app is connected, but changes are still not deploying, you can manually trigger a rebuild from your dashboard.

## Manually triggering a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your latest commit was successful.">
    Check that your latest commit appears in your docs repository and did not encounter any errors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually trigger a deployment.">
    Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and select the deploy button.

## Deleting a deployment

You can delete individual deployments from the danger zone in your organization settings. This is useful when you want to remove a specific deployment without deleting your entire organization.

### Prerequisites

You need the `deployment.delete` permission to delete a deployment. See [roles](/dashboard/roles) for more information about permissions.

### How to delete a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the danger zone.">
    Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com), select your deployment, then navigate to **Settings** → **Organization** → **Danger zone**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete your deployment.">
    In the "Delete my deployment" section, provide a reason for deletion and confirm. Your deployment will be deleted immediately and cannot be restored.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What happens after deletion

- If you have other deployments in your organization, you'll be redirected to the next available deployment
- If this is your only deployment, you'll be redirected to the Mintlify homepage
- All deployment artifacts, including preview deployments, are permanently deleted
- If you have an active subscription for this deployment, it will be cancelled and you'll receive a prorated credit for any unused time

<Warning>
Deleting a deployment is different from deleting your organization. When you delete a deployment, only that specific deployment is removed. Your organization, other deployments, and team members remain intact.
</Warning>
