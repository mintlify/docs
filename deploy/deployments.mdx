Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub account or organization that owns your docs repository has the GitHub App installed. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/deploy/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If you have the GitHub App installed, but changes are still not deploying, manually trigger a <RainbowText>deployment</RainbowText> from your dashboard.
