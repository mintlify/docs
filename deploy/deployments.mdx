Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub app is installed on the account or organization that owns your docs repository. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/deploy/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If the GitHub app is connected, but changes are still not deploying, you can manually trigger a rebuild from your dashboard.

## Manually trigger a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your latest commit was successful.">
    Check that your latest commit appears in your docs repository and did not encounter any errors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually trigger a deployment.">
    Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and select the deploy button.

## Delete a deployment

You can permanently delete a deployment from the [Danger zone](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/danger-zone) in your dashboard settings. This action is irreversible and will remove all deployment data, including any associated preview deployments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Danger zone.">
    Go to the [Danger zone](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/danger-zone) in the settings page of your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete the deployment.">
    1. In the **Delete my deployment** section, provide a reason for deletion.
    2. Click the delete button. You'll be asked to confirm the deletion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Deleting a deployment is permanent and cannot be undone. If you have an active subscription, you'll receive a prorated credit for any unused time remaining in your billing period.
</Warning>

If you have multiple deployments, you'll be redirected to another deployment after deletion. If this was your only deployment, you'll be redirected to the Mintlify homepage.
