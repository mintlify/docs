Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub app is installed on the account or organization that owns your docs repository. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/deploy/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If the GitHub app is connected, but changes are still not deploying, you can manually trigger a rebuild from your dashboard.

## Manually triggering a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your latest commit was successful.">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Manually trigger a deployment.">

## Deleting a deployment

You can delete individual deployments from the danger zone in your organization settings. This is useful when you want to remove a specific deployment without affecting your entire organization.

<Warning>
  Deleting a deployment is permanent and cannot be undone. All associated data, including preview deployments, will be deleted.
</Warning>

### Required permissions

To delete a deployment, you need the `deployment.delete` permission. This permission is typically granted to Admin users. See [Roles](/dashboard/roles) for more information about permissions.

### What happens after deletion

When you delete a deployment:

- All deployment data and artifacts are permanently removed
- Preview deployments associated with the deployment are deleted
- If you have an active subscription, you'll receive a prorated credit for any unused time
- You'll be redirected to another deployment in your organization, or to the Mintlify homepage if no other deployments exist

### Deleting a deployment vs. deleting an organization

- **Deleting a deployment**: Removes a single deployment while keeping your organization, other deployments, and team members intact
- **Deleting an organization**: Permanently removes your entire organization, all deployments, team members, and data

To delete a deployment, navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Danger zone** in your dashboard.
