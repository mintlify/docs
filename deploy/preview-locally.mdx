Use the [CLI](/installation) to preview your documentation locally as you write and edit. Changes appear in real-time.

## Generate a local preview

To generate a local preview, navigate to your documentation directory (where your `docs.json` file is located) and run:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation opens in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Select a custom port

By default, the CLI uses port 3000. To generate a preview on a different port, use the `--port` flag.

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that is already in use, the CLI uses the next available port.

## Skip OpenAPI processing

If you have many OpenAPI files, skip OpenAPI file processing with the `--disable-openapi` flag during local development to improve performance.

```bash
mint dev --disable-openapi
```

## Preview as a specific group

If you use partial authentication to restrict access to your documentation, preview as a specific authentication group with the `--groups [groupname]` flag.

For example, if you have a group named `admin`, you can preview as a member of that group with the command:

```bash
mint dev --groups admin
```
