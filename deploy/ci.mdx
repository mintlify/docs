<Info>
  [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=docs-ci) include CI checks for GitHub repositories.
</Info>

Use CI checks to lint your docs for errors and provide warnings before you deploy. Mintlify CI checks run on pull requests against a configured deployment branch.

## Installation

To begin, follow the steps on the [GitHub](/deploy/github) page.

<Tip>
  Only access to the repository where your documentation content exists is required, so it is highly recommended to only grant access to that repository. 
</Tip>

## Configuration

Configure the CI checks enabled for a deployment by navigating to the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard. Enable the checks that you want to run.

When enabling checks, you can choose to run them at a `Warning` or `Blocking` level.

- A `Warning` level check will never provide a failure status, even if there is an error or suggestions.
- A `Blocking` level check will provide a failure status if there is an error or suggestions.

## Available CI checks

### Broken links

Similar to how the [CLI link checker](/installation#find-broken-links) works on your local machine, the 
broken link CI check automatically searches your documentation content for broken internal links.

To see the results of this check, visit GitHub's check results page for a specific commit.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open source rule-based prose linter which supports a range of document types, including Markdown and MDX.

Mintlify supports automatically running Vale in a CI check and displaying the results as a check status.

#### Configuration
If you have a `.vale.ini` file in the root content directory for your deployment, the Vale CI check uses that configuration file and any configuration files in your specified `stylesPath`.

If you don't have a Vale config file, the default configuration automatically loads.

````mdx Default vale.ini configuration expandable
# Top level styles
StylesPath = /app/styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
IgnoredScopes = code, tt, img, url, a
SkippedScopes = script, style, pre, figure, code

<Note>
Please note that for security reasons, absolute `stylesPath`, or `stylesPath` which include `..` values aren't supported. Please use relative paths and include the `stylesPath` in your repository.
</Note>

#### Packages
Vale supports a range of [packages](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/packages), which can be used to check for spelling and style errors.
Any packages you include in your repository under the correct `stylesPath` are automatically installed and used in your Vale configuration.

For packages not included in your repository, you may specify any packages from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer), and they're automatically downloaded and used in your Vale configuration.

<Note>
Please note that for security reasons, automatically downloading packages that aren't from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer) is not supported.
</Note>

#### Vale with `MDX`
Vale doesn't natively support `MDX`, but Vale's author has provided a [custom extension](https://github.com/errata-ai/MDX) to support it.

If you prefer not to use this extension, the following lines can be added to the configured `.vale.ini` file:
```ini
[formats]
mdx = md

[*.mdx]
CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}

TokenIgnores = (?sm)((?:import|export) .+?$), \
(?<!`)(<\w+ ?.+ ?\/>)(?!`), \
(<[A-Z]\w+>.+?<\/[A-Z]\w+>)

BlockIgnores = (?sm)^(<\w+\n .*\s\/>)$, \
(?sm)^({.+.*})
```

To use Vale's in-document comments, use MDX-style comments `{/* ... */}`. If you use the `CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}` [setting](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/commentdelimiters) in your configuration, Vale automatically interprets these comments while linting. This means you can easily use Vale's built-in features, like skipping lines or sections.

```mdx
{/* vale off */}

This text is ignored by Vale

{/* vale on */}
```


If you choose not to use `CommentDelimiters` but still choose to use Vale's comments, you must wrap any Vale comments in MDX comments `{/* ... */}`. For example:

```mdx
{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

This text is ignored by Vale

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}
```
These comment tags aren't supported within Mintlify components but will function correctly anywhere at the base level of a document.
