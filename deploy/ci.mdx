<Info>
  [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=docs-ci) include CI checks for GitHub repositories.
</Info>

Use CI checks to lint your docs for errors and provide warnings before you deploy. Mintlify CI checks run on pull requests against a configured deployment branch.

## Installation

To begin, follow the steps on the [GitHub](/deploy/github) page.

<Tip>
  Only access to the repository where your documentation content exists is required, so it is highly recommended to only grant access to that repository. 
</Tip>

## Configuration

Configure the CI checks enabled for a deployment by navigating to the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard. Enable the checks that you want to run.

When enabling checks, you can choose to run them at a `Warning` or `Blocking` level.

- A `Warning` level check will never provide a failure status, even if there is an error or suggestions.
- A `Blocking` level check will provide a failure status if there is an error or suggestions.

## Available CI checks

### Broken links

Similar to how the [CLI link checker](/installation#find-broken-links) works on your local machine, the 
broken link CI check automatically searches your documentation content for broken internal links.

To see the results of this check, visit GitHub's check results page for a specific commit.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open source rule-based prose linter which supports a range of document types, including Markdown and MDX. Use Vale to check for consistency of style and tone in your documentation.

Mintlify supports automatically running Vale in a CI check and displaying the results as a check status.

#### Configuration
If you have a `.vale.ini` file in the root content directory of your deployment, the Vale CI check uses that configuration file and any configuration files in your specified `stylesPath`.

If you don't have a Vale config file, the default configuration automatically loads.

````mdx Default vale.ini configuration expandable
# Top level styles
StylesPath = /app/styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
# Inline HTML tags to ignore (code/tt for code snippets, img/url for links/images, a for anchor tags)
IgnoredScopes = code, tt, img, url, a
SkippedScopes = script, style, pre, figure

# Vocabularies
Vocab = Mintlify

# Packages
Packages = MDX

# Only match MDX
[*.mdx]
BasedOnStyles = Vale
Vale.Terms = NO # Enforces really harsh capitalization rules, keep off

# Ignore JSX/MDX-specific syntax patterns
# `import ...`, `export ...`
# `<Component ... />`
# `<Component>...</Component>`
# `{ ... }`
TokenIgnores = (?sm)((?:import|export) .+?$), \
(?<!`)(<\w+ ?.+ ?\/>)(?!`), \
(<[A-Z]\w+>.+?<\/[A-Z]\w+>)

# Exclude multiline JSX and curly braces
# `<Component \n ... />`
BlockIgnores = (?sm)^(<\w+\n .*\s\/>)$, \
(?sm)^({.+.*})
````

To add your own vocabulary for the default configuration, create a `styles/config/vocabularies/Mintlify` directory with `accept.txt` and `reject.txt` files.

- `accept.txt`: Words that should be ignored by the Vale linter. For example, product names or uncommon terms.
- `reject.txt`: Words that should be flagged as errors. For example, jargon or words that are not appropriate for the tone of your documentation.

```text Example Vale file structure
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- .vale.ini
  |- styles/
    |- config/
      |- vocabularies/
        |- Mintlify/
          |- accept.txt
          |- reject.txt
  |- example-page.mdx
```

```text Example monorepo Vale file structure
/your-monorepo
  |- main.ts
  |- docs/
    |- docs.json
    |- .vale.ini
    |- styles/
      |- config/
      |- vocabularies/
        |- Mintlify/
          |- accept.txt
          |- reject.txt
    |- example-page.mdx
  |- test/
```

<Note>
For security reasons, absolute `stylesPath`, or `stylesPath` which include `..` values aren't supported.

Use relative paths and include the `stylesPath` in your repository.
</Note>

#### Packages
Vale supports a range of [packages](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/packages), which can be used to check for spelling and style errors. Any packages you include in your repository under the correct `stylesPath` are automatically installed and used in your Vale configuration.

For packages not included in your repository, you may specify any packages from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer), and they're automatically downloaded and used in your Vale configuration.

<Note>
For security reasons, automatically downloading packages that aren't from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer) is **not** supported.
</Note>

#### Vale with `MDX`

<Note>
MDX native support requires Vale 3.10.0 or later. Check your Vale version with `vale --version`.
</Note>

To use Vale's in-document comments in MDX files, use MDX-style comments `{/* ... */}`:

```mdx
{/* vale off */}

This text is ignored by Vale

{/* vale on */}
```

Vale automatically recognizes and respects these comments in MDX files without additional configuration. Use comments to skip lines or sections that should be ignored by the linter.
