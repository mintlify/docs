This guide walks you through setting up the Mintlify GitHub App on your GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) installation. To connect a GHES instance to Mintlify, you must create a local version of our app within your self-hosted environment that communicates with our remote server.

If you use a cloud-hosted GitHub instance, see the [GitHub](/deploy/github) page for setup instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Admin privileges on your GitHub Enterprise Server Organization where you want to install the app
- Access to your organization's repositories where you want to install the app
- Network connectivity to communicate with our external services (see [Network requirements](#network-requirements) section below)

### Network requirements

#### Outbound connectivity

Your GitHub Enterprise Server must be able to reach:
- Mintlify's API endpoints (https://leaves.mintlify.com)
- Webhook receivers (port 443)

#### Firewall configuration

The following outbound connections must be allowed:
- Connections from Mintlify's static IP: `54.242.90.151`
- HTTPS (port 443) to Mintlify's service domains
- DNS resolution for Mintlify's service domains

## Create the GitHub App
Navigate to Site Admin Settings
Log into your GitHub Enterprise Server as a site administrator
Go to https://your-github-server.com/customer-domain/ (replace with your actual domain)
Click on "Site admin" in the top navigation
Access GitHub Apps Management
In the left sidebar, click "GitHub Apps"
Click "New GitHub App"
Configure Basic App Information
GitHub App name: Mintlify
Description: Integration with Mintlify services
Homepage URL: https://mintlify.com
User authorization callback URL: https://your-github-server.com/ (your GRES domain)
We won’t be using this for the manual configuration

## Configure App Permissions
Set the following permissions for the app. No Organization, Account, or Enterprise Permissions are required:
Repository Permissions
Checks: Read & Write
Contents: Read & Write
Deployments: Read & Write
Metadata: Read-only
Pull Requests: Read & Write
Subscribe to Events
Select the following webhook events:
Installation Target
Create
Delete
Public
Pull Request
Push
Repository

## Generate and Secure Credentials
Create the App
Click "Create GitHub App"
You'll be redirected to the app's settings page
Generate Private Key
Scroll down to "Private keys" section
Click "Generate a private key"
IMPORTANT: Download and securely store this .pem file
Note App Credentials
Record the App ID (visible at the top of the settings page)
Record the Client ID (in the "About" section)
Generate a Client Secret and record it securely

## Install the App
Navigate to App Installation
From the app settings page, click "Install App" in the left sidebar
Select your organization from the list
Choose Installation Scope
Select either:
All repositories (for organization-wide access)
Only select repositories (choose specific repositories)
This is the recommended option
Complete Installation
Click "Install"
Note the Installation ID from the URL (e.g., https://your-github-server.com/settings/installations/12345 - the number 12345 is your Installation ID)

## Configure Webhook URL
Return to App Settings
Go back to your app's settings page
Scroll to "Webhook" section
Set Webhook URL
Webhook URL: https://leaves.mintlify.com/github-enterprise/:subdomain (we'll provide the exact URL)
Webhook secret: Generate a random string (32+ characters) and record it securely. Mintlify can also generate this and provide it to you.
This can be left inactive until Mintlify completes their side of the setup process.

##Credentials to Share with Us
Please share the following information with our team using your secure information transfer method of choice:
### Required Credentials
GitHub Enterprise Server base URL: https://your-github-server.com
App ID: (from Step 3)
App Client ID: (from Step 3)
App Client Secret: (from Step 3)
Installation ID: (from Step 4)
Private Key: The entire contents of the .pem file (should be shared via secure file transfer)
Webhook Secret: (from Step 5)
### Optional Information (Helpful for Troubleshooting)
Organization Name: Your GitHub organization name
Repository Names: Specific repositories where the app is installed
GitHub Enterprise Server Version: (found in site admin dashboard)

## Our Work
We will take the credentials you’ve provided us and store them, encrypted, in a secure location. From there, we will work with you to either

Integrate your GRES environment with an existing Mintlify deployment
Integrate your GRES environment with a new Mintlify deployment we provision for you

After that, you should be able to enable Webhooks for your GitHub App - the Webhook URL may change based on our configuration, and we can test integration.

## Testing the Integration
Verify Webhook Delivery
Go to your app settings → "Advanced" tab
Check "Recent Deliveries" for successful webhook deliveries
Look for HTTP 200 responses
Test Repository Access
Create a test issue or pull request in an installed repository
Verify that our service responds appropriately

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="The app installation is failing with permission errors">
Ensure you have:

- Site admin privileges for app creation
- Organization owner/admin rights for app installation
- Proper repository permissions if installing on specific repositories
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhooks aren't being delivered">
- Verify the webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Ensure your firewall allows outbound HTTPS connections
- Check the webhook secret matches what was configured
- Review webhook delivery logs in GitHub App settings → Advanced tab
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'm getting SSL/TLS certificate errors">
Your GRES might use self-signed certificates. Our services cannot verify your server's certificate.

**Solution:** Ensure your GRES has a valid SSL certificate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The app seems to install but doesn't respond to events">
- Ensure webhooks are being delivered and acknowledged by our server with response code 200
- Required permissions were granted during installation
- Ask the Mintlify team if the application is having trouble writing status updates to the GRES (checks, deployments, etc.)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I limit which repositories the app accesses?">
Yes, during installation you can select "Only select repositories" and choose specific ones. You can modify this later in your organization's installed apps settings. This is the recommended form of installation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I update app permissions later?">
- Go to the app settings as a site admin
- Modify permissions as needed
- The app will need to be re-approved by organization owners
- Notify us of any permission changes as they may affect functionality
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Our GRES is behind a corporate firewall/nginx proxy/etc.">
You'll need to:

- Whitelist our service domains in your firewall
- Ensure outbound HTTPS (port 443) connectivity
- Consider setting up a proxy if direct internet access isn't allowed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can this work with GRES in air-gapped environments?">
No, your GRES must be able to communicate with our cloud-hosted server.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Who should I contact if I need help?">
Please reach out to your customer success representative who you've spoken to at Mintlify, or our support team at support@mintlify.com with:

- Your GitHub Enterprise Server version
- Specific error messages
- Screenshots of any issues
- Network/firewall configuration details (if relevant)
