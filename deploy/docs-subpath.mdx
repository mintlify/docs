Host your documentation at a subpath like `your-domain.com/docs` to keep your docs on your main domain, which makes them easier to find and maintains a cohesive brand experience for your users.

## Set up by hosting provider

Setting up a `/docs` subpath varies depending on your hosting provider. Choose your hosting provider and follow the setup instructions.

- [Cloudflare](/deploy/cloudflare): Set up Cloudflare Workers for your domain to serve your documentation at the `/docs` subpath.
- [AWS Route 53 and CloudFront](/deploy/route53-cloudfront): Deploy your documentation at the `/docs` subpath using AWS with Route 53 DNS and CloudFront CDN.
- [Vercel](/deploy/vercel#host-from-docs) - Use rewrites to deploy your documentation at the `/docs` subpath.
- [Custom reverse proxy](/deploy/reverse-proxy) - For other hosting platforms, set up a reverse proxy to deploy your documentation at the `/docs` subpath.

### Additional configuration for strict security policies

If you proxy all traffic on your custom domain, you may need to configure your proxy or firewall rules to add the correct [headers](/deploy/csp-configuration) so your documentation displays properly.
