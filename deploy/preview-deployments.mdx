<Info>
  Preview deployments are available on [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=preview-deployments).

Preview deployments let you see how changes to your docs will look before merging to production. Each preview creates a shareable URL that updates automatically as you push new changes. 

Preview URLs are publicly viewable by default. Share a preview link with anyone who needs to review your changes.
