<Info>
  Preview deployments are available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=preview-deployments).
</Info>

Preview deployments let you see how changes to your docs will look before merging to production. Each preview creates a shareable URL that updates automatically as you push new changes. 

Preview URLs are publicly viewable by default. Share a preview link with anyone who needs to review your changes.

## Create preview deployments

Preview deployments are created automatically through pull requests or manually from your dashboard.

### Automatic previews

<Note>
  Automatic previews are only created for pull requests targeting your [deployment branch](/guides/git-concepts#deployment-branch).
</Note>

When you create a pull request, the Mintlify bot automatically adds a link to view the preview deployment in your pull request. The preview updates each time you push new commits to the branch.

### Manual previews

You can manually create a preview for any branch.

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).
2. Select **Previews**.
3. Select **Create custom preview**.
4. Enter the name of the branch you want to preview.
5. Select **Create deployment**.

## Redeploy a preview

Redeploy a preview to refresh content or retry after a failed deployment.

1. Select the preview from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

## Restrict access to preview deployments

By default, preview deployments are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. You can restrict access to authenticated members of your Mintlify organization.

1. Navigate to the **Previews** section in the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard.
2. Click the **Preview authentication** toggle to enable or disable preview authentication.

## Preview widget

When viewing a preview deployment, a floating widget appears in the bottom-right corner of the page. The widget helps you quickly navigate between changed files and understand what's different from the production deployment.

</Frame>

### Features

- **Changed files list**: View all files that were added, modified, or removed in the preview
- **Status badges**: Each file shows a badge indicating whether it was added, modified, or removed
- **Search**: Filter the file list by searching for specific file names or page titles
- **Quick navigation**: Click any file to navigate directly to that page
- **Drag and drop**: Reposition the widget by dragging it to your preferred location on the screen
- **Mobile support**: On mobile devices, the widget opens as a full-screen modal

The widget only appears on preview deployments, not on your production site.

## Troubleshooting preview deployments

If your preview deployment fails, try these troubleshooting steps.

- **View the build logs**: In your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/), go to **Previews** and click the failed preview. The deployment logs show errors that caused failures.
- **Check your configuration**:
   - Invalid `docs.json` syntax
   - Missing or incorrect file paths referenced in your navigation
   - Invalid frontmatter in MDX files
   - Broken image links or missing image files
- **Validate locally**: Run `mint dev` locally to catch build errors before pushing to the repository.
- **Check recent changes**: Review the most recent commits in your branch to identify what changes caused the build to fail.
