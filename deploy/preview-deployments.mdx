<Info>
  Preview deployments are available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=preview-deployments).
</Info>

Preview deployments let you see how changes to your docs will look before merging to production. Each preview creates a shareable URL that updates automatically as you push new changes. 

Preview URLs are publicly viewable by default. Share a preview link with anyone who needs to review your changes.

## Create preview deployments

Preview deployments are created automatically through pull requests or manually from your dashboard.

### Automatic previews

When you create a pull request, the Mintlify bot automatically adds a link to view the preview deployment in your pull request. The preview updates each time you push new commits to the branch.

2. Click the **Preview authentication** toggle to enable or disable preview authentication.
