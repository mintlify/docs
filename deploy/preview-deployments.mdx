<Info>
  Preview deployments are available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=preview-deployments).
</Info>

Preview deployments let you see how changes to your docs will look before merging to production. Each preview creates a shareable URL that updates automatically as you push new changes. 

Preview URLs are publicly viewable by default. Share a preview link with anyone who needs to review your changes.

## Create preview deployments

Preview deployments are created automatically through pull requests or manually from your dashboard.

### Automatic previews

<Note>
  Automatic previews are only created for pull requests targeting your [deployment branch](/guides/git-concepts#deployment-branch).
</Note>

When you create a pull request, the Mintlify bot automatically adds a link to view the preview deployment in your pull request. The preview updates each time you push new commits to the branch.

### Manual previews

You can manually create a preview for any branch.

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).
2. Select **Previews**.
3. Select **Create custom preview**.
4. Enter the name of the branch you want to preview.
5. Select **Create deployment**.

## Redeploy a preview

Redeploy a preview to refresh content or retry after a failed deployment.

1. Select the preview from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).
2. Select **Redeploy**.

## Preview widget

Preview deployments include a widget that displays all changed files in your pull request. The widget appears as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of preview deployments only.

### Features

- **File list**: View all added, modified, and removed files with status badges
- **Search**: Filter files by name or title to quickly find specific changes
- **Navigation**: Click any file to navigate directly to that page in the preview
- **Drag and drop**: Reposition the widget by dragging it to your preferred location on screen

The widget automatically saves your preferred position and restores it when you reopen the preview.

## Restrict access to preview deployments

By default, preview deployments are publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. You can restrict access to authenticated members of your Mintlify organization.

1. Navigate to the **Previews** section in the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard.
2. Click the **Preview authentication** toggle to enable or disable preview authentication.

## Troubleshooting preview deployments

If your preview deployment fails, try these troubleshooting steps.

- **View the build logs**: In your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/), go to **Previews** and click the failed preview. The deployment logs show errors that caused failures.
- **Check your configuration**:
   - Invalid `docs.json` syntax
   - Missing or incorrect file paths referenced in your navigation
   - Invalid frontmatter in MDX files
   - Broken image links or missing image files
- **Validate locally**: Run `mint dev` locally to catch build errors before pushing to the repository.
- **Check recent changes**: Review the most recent commits in your branch to identify what changes caused the build to fail.
