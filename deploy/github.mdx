Mintlify uses a GitHub App to automatically sync your documentation with your GitHub repository.

## Installing the GitHub App

Install the Mintlify GitHub App on the GitHub account or organization that owns your docs repository. You must have organization ownership or admin permissions in a repository to install the app. If you lack the necessary permissions, the repository owner must approve the installation request.

Install the Mintlify GitHub App through your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

<Tip>
We recommend granting access only to the repository where your docs are hosted.

## Permissions

When you install the GitHub app, you will be prompted to grant the following permissions:

Read permissions:
* `metadata`: Basic repository information

Read and write permissions:
* `checks`: Create status checks on pull requests
* `code`: Read file changes when you commit to your docs branch
* `deployments`: Generate preview deployments for pull requests
* `pull requests`: Create branches and pull requests from the web editor
* `workflows`: Manage GitHub Actions for docs deployments

<Info>
The app only accesses repositories that you explicitly grant it access to. If you have branch protection rules enabled, the app cannot push directly to protected branches.
</Info>

## Managing repository access

When installing our GitHub App, you can grant access to all of your repositories or specific ones. We recommend only granting access to the repositories where your documentation is located. You can modify this selection anytime in your [GitHub app settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Configuring docs source

Change the organization, repository, or branch that your documentation is built from in the [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) section of your dashboard.

### Feedback add-ons are unavailable

If you cannot enable the edit suggestions or raise issues options in your dashboard and your repository is public, revalidate your Git settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Git Settings">
    Go to [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revalidate your settings">
    Click the green check mark in the corner of the Git settings box to revalidate your repository settings. This will force update your repository settings to reflect whether your repository is public or private.
