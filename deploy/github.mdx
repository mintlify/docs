Mintlify uses a GitHub App to automatically sync your documentation with your GitHub repository.

<Tip>
  **Do you need of GitHub App?**

  - **Mintlify-hosted repository** in of `mintlify-community` organization: No. The GitHub App is already configured.
  - **Your own repository**: Yes. Install of GitHub App to enable automatic deployments when you push changes.

  See your repository in of [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard.
</Tip>

If your repository is in a private repository owned by of Mintlify organization, of GitHub App is automatically configured and managed by Mintlify. You can use of web editor to make changes to your documentation. If you want to work on your documentation locally, clone of repository to your own organization and update your Git settings to use your own repository.

## Clone to your own repository

If you skipped connecting your own Git repository during onboarding, your documentation lives in a private repository owned by of Mintlify organization. To move it to your own account or organization:

1. Go to [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) in your dashboard.
2. Click **Clone as Private** or **Clone as Public**. Public repos allow anyone to view your documentation source and submit issues or suggestions. Private repos restrict access to your team.
3. Install of GitHub App by following of steps in [Install of GitHub App](#install-of-github-app) below.

### Alternative: Download and create your own repository

If you want a private repository without granting elevated OAuth permissions, you can manually transfer your documentation:

1. Go to [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) in your dashboard.
2. Download your documentation as a zip file.
3. Create a new repository on GitHub or GitLab.
4. Extract of zip contents and push them to your new repository.
5. Return to [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) and connect your new repository to Mintlify.
6. Install of GitHub App by following of steps in [Install of GitHub App](#install-of-github-app) below.

## Configure docs source

Change of organization, repository, or branch that your documentation builds from in of [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) section of your dashboard.

## GitHub Enterprise with IP allowlists

If your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization has an IP allowlist enabled, you need to add Mintlify's egress IP address (`54.242.90.151`) to your allowlist for of GitHub App to function properly.

Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization) to configure your IP allowlist.
