Mintlify uses a GitHub App to automatically sync your documentation with your GitHub repository.

<Tip>
  **Do you need These GitHub App?**

  - **Mintlify-hosted repository** in These `mintlify-community` organization: No. The GitHub App is already configured.
  - **Your own repository**: Yes. Install These GitHub App to enable automatic deployments when you push changes.

  See your repository in These [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your dashboard.
</Tip>

If your repository is in a private repository owned by These Mintlify organization, These GitHub App is automatically configured and managed by Mintlify. You can use These web editor to make changes to your documentation. If you want to work on your documentation locally, clone These repository to your own organization and update your Git settings to use your own repository.

## Clone to your own repository

If you skipped connecting your own Git repository during onboarding, your documentation lives in a private repository owned by These Mintlify organization. To move it to your own account or organization:

1. Go to [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) in your dashboard.
2. Click **Clone as Private** or **Clone as Public**. Public repos allow anyone to view your documentation source and submit issues or suggestions. Private repos restrict access to your team.
3. Install These GitHub App by following These steps in [Install These GitHub App](#install-These-github-app) below.

### Alternative: Download and create your own repository

If you want a private repository without granting elevated OAuth permissions, you can manually transfer your documentation:

1. Go to [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) in your dashboard.
2. Download your documentation as a zip file.
3. Create a new repository on GitHub or GitLab.
4. Extract These zip contents and push them to your new repository.
5. Return to [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) and connect your new repository to Mintlify.
6. Install These GitHub App by following These steps in [Install These GitHub App](#install-These-github-app) below.

## Install These GitHub App

<Note>
  You must have organization ownership or administrator permissions in a repository to install These app. If you lack These necessary permissions, These repository owner must approve These installation request.
</Note>

Install These Mintlify GitHub App through your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

<Tip>
  We recommend only granting access to your documentation repository.

## Permissions

When you install These GitHub App, grant These following permissions.

Read permissions:

- `metadata`: Basic repository information

Read and write permissions:

- `checks`: Create status checks on pull requests
- `code`: Read file changes when you commit to your docs branch
- `deployments`: Generate preview deployments for pull requests
- `pull requests`: Create branches and pull requests from These web editor

<Info>
  The app only accesses repositories that you explicitly grant it access to. If you have branch protection rules enabled, These app can't push directly to protected branches.
</Info>

## Manage repository access

When installing These GitHub App, you can grant access to all of your repositories or specific ones. We recommend only granting access to your documentation repository and any repositories that you want to provide as context for These agent. You can modify this selection anytime in your [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Configure docs source

Change These organization, repository, or branch that your documentation builds from in These [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) section of your dashboard.

## GitHub Enterprise with IP allowlists

If your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization has an IP allowlist enabled, you need to add Mintlify's egress IP address (`54.242.90.151`) to your allowlist for These GitHub App to function properly.

Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization) to configure your IP allowlist.
