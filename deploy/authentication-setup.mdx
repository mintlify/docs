<Info>
  [Pro plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication) include password authentication.

  [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication) include all authentication methods.
</Info>

Authentication requires users to log in before accessing your documentation.

## Authentication modes

Choose between full and partial authentication modes based on your access control needs.

**Full authentication**: All pages are protected. Users must log in before accessing any content.

**Partial authentication**: Some pages are publicly viewable while others require authentication. Users can browse public content freely and authenticate only when accessing protected pages.

When configuring any handshake method below, you'll select either **Full authentication** or **Partial authentication** in your dashboard settings.

## Configuring authentication

Select the handshake method that you want to configure.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Password">
<Info>
Password authentication provides access control only and does **not** support content personalization.
</Info>

### Prerequisites

* Your security requirements allow sharing passwords among users.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a password.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **Password**.
    4. Enter a secure password.
    5. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribute access.">
    Securely share the password and documentation URL with authorized users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` and you need basic access control without tracking individual users. You want to prevent public access while keeping setup simple. 

**Create a strong password** in your dashboard. **Share credentials** with authorized users. That's it!
</Tab>
<Tab title="Mintlify Dashboard">
### Prerequisites

* Your documentation users are also your documentation editors.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Mintlify dashboard authentication.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **Mintlify Auth**.
    4. Select **Enable Mintlify Auth**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add authorized users.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Members](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
    2. Add each person who should have access to your documentation.
    3. Assign appropriate roles based on their editing permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` and your team uses the dashboard to edit your docs. You want to restrict access to team members only.

**Enable Mintlify authentication** in your dashboard settings.

**Verify team access** by checking that all team members are added to your organization.
</Tab>
<Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
### Prerequisites

* An OAuth or OIDC server that supports the Authorization Code Flow.
* Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens (optional, to enable personalization features).

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth settings.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **OAuth** and configure these fields:
      * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth endpoint.
      * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
      * **Client Secret**: Your OAuth 2.0 client secret.
      * **Scopes**: Permissions to request. Copy the **entire** scope string (for example, for a scope like `provider.users.docs`, copy the complete `provider.users.docs`). Use multiple scopes if you need different access levels.
      * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
      * **Info API URL** (optional): Endpoint to retrieve user info for personalization. If omitted, the OAuth flow will only be used to verify identity and the user info will be empty.
      * **Logout URL**: The native logout URL for your OAuth provider. If your provider has a `returnTo` or similar parameter, point it back to your docs URL.
    4. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
    1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Add the redirect URL as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your user info endpoint (optional).">
    To enable personalization features, create an API endpoint that:
    * Accepts OAuth access tokens for authentication.
    * Returns user data in the `User` format. See [User data format](/deploy/personalization-setup#user-data-format) for more information.
    
    Add this endpoint URL to the **Info API URL** field in your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `foo.com/docs` and you have an existing OAuth server at `auth.foo.com` that supports the Authorization Code Flow.

**Configure your OAuth server details** in your dashboard:
- **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
- **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
- **Scopes**: `['provider.users.docs']`
- **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
- **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`
- **Logout URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/logout?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Ffoo.com%2Fdocs`

**Create a user info endpoint** at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`, which requires an OAuth access token with the `provider.users.docs` scope, and returns:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "groups": ["engineering", "admin"]
}
```

**Configure your OAuth server to allow redirects** to your callback URL.
</Tab>
<Tab title="JWT">
### Prerequisites

* An authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs.
* A backend service that can create redirect URLs.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **JWT**.
    4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
    5. Select **Generate new key**.
    6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate Mintlify authentication into your login flow.">
    Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user authentication:
    
    * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the `User` format. See [User data format](/deploy/personalization-setup#user-data-format) for more information.
    * Sign the JWT with your secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm.
    * Create a redirect URL back to the `/login/jwt-callback` path of your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` with an existing authentication system at `foo.com`. You want to extend your login flow to grant access to the docs while keeping your docs separate from your dashboard (or you don't have a dashboard).

Create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that extends your existing authentication.

After verifying user credentials:
* Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
* Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000), // 2 week session expiration
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    content: {
      firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
      lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s') // 10 second JWT expiration
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#${jwt}`);
}
```

```python Python
import jwt # pyjwt
import os

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

private_key = os.getenv(MINTLIFY_JWT_PEM_SECRET_NAME, '')

@router.get('/auth')
async def return_mintlify_auth_status(current_user):
  jwt_token = jwt.encode(
    payload={
      'exp': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)).timestamp()),    # 10 second JWT expiration
      'expiresAt': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)).timestamp()), # 1 week session expiration
      'groups': ['admin'] if current_user.is_admin else [],
      'content': {
        'firstName': current_user.first_name,
        'lastName': current_user.last_name,
      },
    },
    key=private_key,
    algorithm='EdDSA'
  )

  return RedirectResponse(url=f'https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{jwt_token}', status_code=302)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Redirecting unauthenticated users

When an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, their intended destination is preserved in the redirect to your login URL:

1. User attempts to visit a protected page: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart`.
2. Redirect to your login URL with a redirect query parameter: `https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart`.
3. After authentication, redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback?redirect=%2Fquickstart#{SIGNED_JWT}`.
4. User lands in their original destination.

</Tabs>

## Making pages public

When using partial authentication, all pages are protected by default. You can make specific pages viewable without authentication at the page or group level with the `public` property.

### Page level

To make a page public, add `public: true` to the page's frontmatter.

```mdx Public page example
---
title: "Public page"
public: true
---
```

### Group level

To make all pages in a group public, add `"public": true` beneath the group's name in the `navigation` object of your `docs.json`.

```json Public group example
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Public group",
        "public": true,
        "icon": "play",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          "installation",
          "settings"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Private group",
        "icon": "pause",
        "pages": [
          "private-information",
          "secret-settings"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
