<Info>
  [Pro plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication) include password authentication.

  [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication) include all authentication methods.
</Info>

Authentication requires users to log in before accessing your documentation. You can configure specific pages or groups as public while keeping other pages protected.

## Configure authentication

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Password">
<Info>
  Password authentication provides access control only and does **not** support user-specific features like group-based access control or API playground pre-filling.
</Info>

### Prerequisites

* Your security requirements allow sharing passwords among users.

### Set up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a password.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication).
    2. Enable authentication.
    3. In the **Password Protection** section, enter a secure password

    After you enter a password, your site redeploys. When it finishes deploying, anyone who visits your site must enter the password to access your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribute access.">
    Securely share the password and documentation URL with authorized users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Mintlify dashboard">
### Prerequisites

* Everyone who needs to access your documentation must be a member of your Mintlify organization.

### Set up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Mintlify dashboard authentication.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication).
    2. Enable authentication.
    3. In the **Custom Authentication** section, click **Mintlify Auth**.
    4. Click **Enable Mintlify Auth**.

    After you enable Mintlify authentication, your site redeploys. When it finishes deploying, anyone who visits your site must log in to your Mintlify organization to access your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add authorized users.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Members](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
    2. Add each person who should have access to your documentation.
    3. Assign appropriate roles based on their editing permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
### Prerequisites

* An OAuth or OIDC server that supports the Authorization Code Flow.
* Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens (optional, to enable group-based access control).

### Set up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth settings.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication).
    2. Enable authentication.
    3. In the **Custom Authentication** section, click **OAuth**.
    4. Configure these fields:
      * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth endpoint.
      * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
      * **Client Secret**: Your OAuth 2.0 client secret.
      * **Scopes** (optional): Permissions to request.
      * **Additional authorization parameters** (optional): Additional query parameters to add to the initial authorization request.
      * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
      * **Info API URL** (optional): Endpoint on your server that Mintlify calls to retrieve user info. Required for group-based access control.
      * **Logout URL** (optional): The native logout URL for your OAuth provider. If not configured, users redirect to `/login`.
      * **Redirect URL** (optional): The URL to redirect users to after authentication.
    5. Click **Save changes**.

    After you configure your OAuth settings, your site redeploys. When it finishes deploying, anyone who visits your site must log in to your OAuth provider to access your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
    1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication).
    2. Add the redirect URL as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your user info endpoint (optional).">
    To enable group-based access control, create an API endpoint that:
    * Responds to `GET` requests.
    * Accepts an `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header for authentication.
    * Returns user data in the `User` format. See [User data format](#user-data-format) for more information.

    Mintlify calls this endpoint with the OAuth access token to retrieve user information.

    Add this endpoint URL to the **Info API URL** field in your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Control session length with the `expiresAt` field in your user info response. This is a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) indicating when the session should expire. See [User data format](#user-data-format) for more details.
</Note>

</Tab>
<Tab title="JWT">
### Prerequisites

* An authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs.
* A backend service that can create redirect URLs.

### Set up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication).
    2. Enable authentication.
    3. In the **Custom Authentication** section, click **JWT**.
    4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow.
    5. Click **Save changes**.
    6. Click **Generate new key**.
    7. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.

    After you generate a private key, your site redeploys. When it finishes deploying, anyone who visits your site must log in to your JWT authentication system to access your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate Mintlify authentication into your login flow.">
    Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user authentication:

    * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the `User` format. See [User data format](#user-data-format) for more information.
    * Sign the JWT with your secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm.
    * Create a redirect URL back to the `/login/jwt-callback` path of your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

After verifying user credentials, generate a JWT with user data and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000), // 2 week session expiration
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    apiPlaygroundInputs: {
      header: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${res.locals.user.apiKey}`,
      },
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s') // 10 second JWT expiration
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#${jwt}`);
}
```

```python Python
import jwt # pyjwt
import os

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

private_key = os.getenv(MINTLIFY_JWT_PEM_SECRET_NAME, '')

@router.get('/auth')
async def return_mintlify_auth_status(current_user):
  jwt_token = jwt.encode(
    payload={
      'exp': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)).timestamp()),    # 10 second JWT expiration
      'expiresAt': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)).timestamp()), # 2 week session expiration
      'groups': ['admin'] if current_user.is_admin else [],
      'apiPlaygroundInputs': {
        'header': {
          'Authorization': f'Bearer {current_user.api_key}',
        },
      },
    },
    key=private_key,
    algorithm='EdDSA'
  )

  return RedirectResponse(url=f'https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{jwt_token}', status_code=302)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Redirect unauthenticated users

When an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, the redirect to your login URL preserves the user's intended destination.

1. User attempts to visit a protected page: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart`.
2. Redirect to your login URL with a redirect query parameter: `https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart`.
3. After authentication, redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback?redirect=%2Fquickstart#{SIGNED_JWT}`.
4. User lands in their original destination.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Make pages public

When using authentication, all pages require authentication by default. You can make specific pages viewable without authentication at the page or group level with the `public` property.

### Individual pages

Add `public: true` to the page's frontmatter.

```mdx Public page example
---
title: "Public page"
public: true
---
```

### Groups of pages

Add `"public": true` beneath the group's name in the `navigation` object of your `docs.json`.

```json Public group example
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Public group",
        "public": true,
        "icon": "play",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          "installation",
          "settings"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Private group",
        "icon": "pause",
        "pages": [
          "private-information",
          "secret-settings"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Control access with groups

When you use OAuth or JWT authentication, you can restrict specific pages to certain user groups. Manage groups through user data passed during authentication. See [User data format](#user-data-format) for details.

```json Example user info
{
  "groups": ["admin", "beta-users"],
  "expiresAt": 1735689600
}
```

Specify which groups can access specific pages using the `groups` property in frontmatter.

```mdx Example page restricted to the admin group highlight={3}
---
title: "Admin dashboard"
groups: ["admin"]
---
```

Users must belong to at least one of the listed groups to access the page. If a user tries to access a page without the required group, they'll receive a 404 error.

### How groups interact with public pages

- All pages require authentication by default.
- Pages with a `groups` property are only accessible to authenticated users in those groups.
- Pages without a `groups` property are accessible to all authenticated users.
- Pages with `public: true` and no `groups` property are accessible to everyone.

<CodeGroup>

```mdx Public page
---
title: "Public guide"
public: true
---
```

```mdx Protected page
---
title: "API reference"
---
```

```mdx Protected page with groups
---
title: "Advanced configurations"
groups: ["pro", "enterprise"]
---
```
</CodeGroup>

## User data format

When using OAuth or JWT authentication, your system returns user data that controls session length, group membership, and [content personalization](/create/personalization).

<CodeGroup>
```tsx Format
type User = {
  expiresAt?: number;
  groups?: string[];
  content?: Record<string, any>;
  apiPlaygroundInputs?: {
    server?: Record<string, string>;
    header?: Record<string, unknown>;
    query?: Record<string, unknown>;
    cookie?: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
};
```

```json Example
{
  "expiresAt": 1735689600,
  "groups": ["admin", "beta-users"],
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "company": "Acme Corp"
  },
  "apiPlaygroundInputs": {
    "header": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer user_abc123"
    },
    "server": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.foo.com"
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<ParamField path="expiresAt" type="number">
  Session expiration time in seconds since epoch. When the current time passes this value, the user must re-authenticate.

  <Warning>**For JWT:** This differs from the JWT's `exp` claim, which determines when a JWT is considered invalid. Set the JWT `exp` claim to a short duration (10 seconds or less) for security. Use `expiresAt` for the actual session length (hours to weeks).</Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="groups" type="string[]">
  List of groups the user belongs to. Pages with matching `groups` in their frontmatter are accessible to this user.

  **Example**: A user with `groups: ["admin", "engineering"]` can access pages tagged with either the `admin` or `engineering` groups.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="content" type="Record<string, any>">
  Custom data accessible in MDX pages via the `user` variable for [personalized content](/create/personalization#dynamic-mdx-content).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="apiPlaygroundInputs" type="object">
  Pre-fills API playground fields with user-specific values. When a user authenticates, these values populate the corresponding input fields in the API playground. Users can override pre-filled values, and their overrides persist in local storage.

  Only values that match the current endpoint's security scheme are applied.

  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField path="header" type="Record<string, unknown>">
      Header values to pre-fill, keyed by header name.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="query" type="Record<string, unknown>">
      Query parameter values to pre-fill, keyed by parameter name.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="cookie" type="Record<string, unknown>">
      Cookie values to pre-fill, keyed by cookie name.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="server" type="Record<string, string>">
      Server variable values to pre-fill, keyed by variable name.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>
