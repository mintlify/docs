<Note>
  If you're currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

```sh
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

And run the new `upgrade` command in your docs repository:

```sh
mintlify upgrade
```

This will generate a `docs.json` based off of your `mint.json`. Then, please delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.

</Note>
