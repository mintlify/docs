Hello! Here's an example accordion:

<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here, including other components, like code:
  ```java HelloWorld.java
  class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>
