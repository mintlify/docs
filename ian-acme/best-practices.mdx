# Best practices

Optimize your Ian ACME experience with these proven strategies.

## Project organization

### Keep projects focused

- Create separate projects for distinct initiatives
- Avoid combining unrelated work in a single project
- Archive completed projects to reduce clutter

### Use consistent naming

Establish naming conventions for projects, tasks, and labels:

- **Projects** - Use clear, action-oriented names (e.g., "Q1 Marketing Campaign")
- **Tasks** - Start with action verbs (e.g., "Write blog post", "Review design")
- **Labels** - Keep them short and descriptive (e.g., "urgent", "bug", "feature")

### Structure with milestones

Break projects into phases using milestones:

1. Define major deliverables as milestones
2. Group related tasks under each milestone
3. Set realistic deadlines for each phase
4. Track progress against milestone completion

## Task management

### Write clear task descriptions

Good task descriptions include:

- **What** needs to be done
- **Why** it's important
- **Who** should be involved
- **When** it should be completed
- **How** success will be measured

Example:

```
Title: Update pricing page
Description: Revise pricing page to reflect new plans. 
Must include comparison table and FAQ section. 
Coordinate with marketing for copy review.
Due: End of week
```

### Set appropriate priorities

Use priority levels effectively:

- **High** - Critical items blocking progress
- **Medium** - Important but not urgent
- **Low** - Nice to have or future considerations

Avoid marking everything as high priority - it defeats the purpose of prioritization.
