Collaborate with your team on documentation using branch-based workflows, pull requests, and preview deployments.

If you aren't familiar with Git, see [Git concepts](/guides/git-concepts).

## Branch-based collaboration

Use branches to work on documentation updates in parallel without affecting your live site.

### Why use branches

- **Isolate changes**: Work on updates without affecting your live documentation.
- **Review before publishing**: Get feedback from team members before changes go live.
- **Parallel work**: Multiple team members can work on different branches simultaneously.

## Recommended workflow

Use pull requests to propose changes and collaborate with your team before merging to your live documentation. This workflow ensures your team reviews changes before publishing and maintains a clear history of updates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a pull request">
    Create a pull request from the editor when you're ready to publish your changes. See <a href="/editor/publish">Publish changes in the web editor</a> for more information on using pull requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review pull requests">
    Review pull requests in your Git provider like GitHub or GitLab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond to feedback">
    When reviewers request changes, make the requested changes and save your changes. Additional changes automatically push to the existing pull request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge pull requests">
    Merge your pull request after addressing all requested changes, required reviewers approve the pull request, and any automated checks pass.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Preview deployments

Preview deployments create temporary URLs where you can see your rendered changes before they go live. Use preview deployments to gather feedback on how changes.

### Access preview deployments

1. Click **Share** in the editor tool bar.
2. Click **Preview** to open the preview deployment in a new tab.
3. The preview URL shows your documentation with all saved changes applied.

  <img src="/images/editor/share-preview-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" alt="Share button in the editor toolbar" />
</Frame>

### Share previews

Share the preview deployment URL with team members to gather feedback. Previews update automatically when you save additional changes.

### Preview authentication

Preview URLs are publicly accessible by default. Enable preview authentication in the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard to restrict access to authenticated organization members.

## Share editor links

Share a direct link to a specific page in the editor with your teammates. Use editor links to collaborate on updates and make changes to pages.

When you open a page, the editor saves the path in the URL. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar to share it with teammates who have access to the editor.

The URL format is:

```
https://dashboard.mintlify.com/{org}/{project}/editor/{branch}?file={filepath}
```

For example, `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/acme/docs/editor/main?file=guides/quickstart.mdx` opens `quickstart.mdx` on the `main` branch.

Anyone with access to your Mintlify organization can use the link to open the file directly in the editor.

<Tip>
  When you share a page, tell people which branch you're working on so they can confirm they view the correct version.

## Add comments

Use comments to provide feedback, ask questions, and collaborate on documentation content. Comments are attached to specific text selections and visible to all team members with access to the editor.

### Add a comment to text

1. Select the text you want to comment on.
2. Click the comment icon in the floating toolbar that appears.
3. Type your comment in the input field.
4. Click **Send comment** or press **Enter** to post your comment.

The commented text is highlighted in the editor, and a gutter icon appears next to the line showing the number of comment threads.

### View comments

View all comments for the current page in the comments sidebar on the right side of the editor.

- Click the comment badge in the top toolbar to open the comments sidebar.
- Click a gutter icon next to commented text to open the sidebar and focus that comment thread.
- Click a comment thread in the sidebar to highlight the associated text in the editor.

### Reply to comments

1. Open the comments sidebar or click on commented text.
2. Type your reply in the **Reply...** input field at the bottom of the thread.
3. Click **Send comment** or press **Enter** to post your reply.

### Resolve comments

Mark a comment thread as resolved when the discussion is complete or the feedback has been addressed.

1. Open the comment thread in the sidebar or by clicking on commented text.
2. Click the checkmark icon on the first comment in the thread.

Resolved comments are removed from the sidebar and the text highlight is removed from the editor.

### Delete comments

Delete individual comments or entire comment threads.

1. Open the comment thread in the sidebar or by clicking on commented text.
2. Hover over the comment you want to delete.
3. Click the trash icon that appears.

Deleting the first comment in a thread deletes the entire thread. Deleting a reply removes only that comment.
