Collaborate with your team on documentation using branch-based workflows, pull requests, and preview deployments.

If you aren't familiar with Git, see [Git concepts](/guides/git-concepts).

## Branch-based collaboration

Use branches to work on documentation updates in parallel without affecting your live site.

### Why use branches

- **Isolate changes**: Work on updates without affecting your live documentation.
- **Review before publishing**: Get feedback from team members before changes go live.
- **Parallel work**: Multiple team members can work on different branches simultaneously.

### Recommended workflow

1. Create a feature branch for your changes.
2. Make and save your changes on the branch.
3. Create a pull request when ready for review.
4. Address feedback and update the branch.
5. Merge the pull request when approved.

This workflow ensures changes are reviewed before going live and maintains a clear history of updates.

## Pull request workflow

Pull requests let you propose changes and collaborate with your team before merging to your live documentation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a pull request">
    Create a pull request from the editor when you're ready to publish your changes. See <a href="/editor/publish">Publish changes in the web editor</a> for more information on using pull requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review pull requests">
    Review pull requests in your Git provider like GitHub or GitLab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond to feedback">
    When reviewers request changes, make the requested changes and save your changes. They will automatically push to the existing pull request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge pull requests">
    Merge your pull request when all requested changes are addressed, the pull request is approved by required reviewers, and any automated checks have passed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Preview deployments

Preview deployments create temporary URLs where you can see your changes before they go live.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access preview deployments">
    - Click **Share** in the editor tool bar.
    - Click **Preview** to open the preview deployment in a new tab.
    - The preview URL shows your documentation with all saved changes applied.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share previews">
    Share the preview deployment URL with team members to gather feedback. Previews update automatically when you save additional changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview authentication">
    Preview URLs are publicly accessible by default. Enable preview authentication in the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard to restrict access to authenticated organization members.
  </Step>
