Collaborate with your team on documentation using branch-based workflows, pull requests, preview deployments, and inline comments.

If you aren't familiar with Git, see [Git essentials for the web editor](/editor/git-essentials).

## Branch-based collaboration

Use branches to work on documentation updates in parallel without affecting your live site.

### Why use branches

- **Isolate changes**: Work on updates without affecting your live documentation.
- **Review before publishing**: Get feedback from team members before changes go live.
- **Parallel work**: Multiple team members can work on different branches simultaneously.

## Add comments

Leave comments on documentation pages to discuss changes, ask questions, or provide feedback to your team. Comments help you collaborate directly in the editor without switching to external tools.

### Create a comment

1. Select text in the editor or click where you want to add a comment.
2. Click the comment icon that appears or use the keyboard shortcut.
3. Type your comment and press **Send**.

Comments appear as threads in the editor sidebar. Team members can reply to comments to continue the discussion.

### Resolve comments

Mark comments as resolved when the discussion is complete or the issue is addressed. Resolved comments are hidden from view but remain accessible in the comment history.

To resolve a comment thread, click **Resolve** in the comment thread.

### Comments in pull requests

Unresolved comments automatically sync to your GitHub pull request description. This keeps your team informed about open discussions without leaving GitHub.

The pull request description includes:
- A summary of unresolved comment threads and participating users
- Links to each commented file
- Preview text from each comment
- Direct links back to the editor to view and respond to comments

Comments sync to the pull request description after a short delay (approximately 5 seconds) to batch multiple changes together. When you resolve comments or add new ones, the pull request description updates automatically.

## Recommended workflow

Use pull requests to propose changes and collaborate with your team before merging to your live documentation. This workflow ensures your team reviews changes before publishing and maintains a clear history of updates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a pull request">
    Create a pull request from the editor when you're ready to publish your changes. See <a href="/editor/publish">Publish changes in the web editor</a> for more information on using pull requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review pull requests">
    Review pull requests in your Git provider like GitHub or GitLab. Unresolved editor comments appear in the pull request description with links back to the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond to feedback">
    When reviewers request changes, make the requested changes and save your changes. Additional changes automatically push to the existing pull request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge pull requests">
    Merge your pull request after addressing all requested changes, required reviewers approve the pull request, and any automated checks pass.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Preview deployments

Preview deployments create temporary URLs where you can see your rendered changes before they go live. Use preview deployments to gather feedback on how changes.

Every time you save changes to a branch, the preview deployment updates automatically.

### Access preview deployments

1. Click **Publish** in the editor tool bar.
2. Click the preview URL open the preview deployment in a new tab. The URL format is `organization-branch-name.mintlify.app`.

  <img src="/images/editor/share-preview-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" alt="Share button in the editor toolbar" />
</Frame>

### Share previews

Share the preview deployment URL with team members to gather feedback. Previews update automatically when you save additional changes.

### Preview authentication

Preview URLs are publicly accessible by default. Enable preview authentication in the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard to restrict access to authenticated organization members.

## Share editor links

Share a direct link to a specific page in the editor with your teammates. Use editor links to collaborate on updates and make changes to pages.

When you open a page, the editor saves the path in the URL. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar to share it with teammates who have access to the editor.

The URL format is: `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/{org}/{project}/editor/{branch}?file={filepath}`

For example, `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/acme/docs/editor/main?file=guides/quickstart.mdx` opens `quickstart.mdx` on the `main` branch.

Anyone with access to your Mintlify organization can use the link to open the file directly in the editor.

<Tip>
  When you share a page, tell people which branch you're working on so they can confirm they view the correct version.
