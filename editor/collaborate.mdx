Collaborate with your team on documentation using branch-based workflows, pull requests, and preview deployments.

## Branch-based collaboration

Use branches to work on documentation updates in parallel without affecting your live site.

### Why use branches

- **Isolate changes**: Work on updates without affecting your live documentation
- **Review before publishing**: Get feedback from team members before changes go live
- **Parallel work**: Multiple team members can work on different branches simultaneously

### Recommended workflow

1. Create a feature branch for your changes
2. Make and save your edits on the branch
3. Create a pull request when ready for review
4. Address feedback and update the PR
5. Merge when approved

This workflow ensures changes are reviewed before going live and maintains a clear history of updates.

## Pull request workflow

Pull requests let you propose changes and collaborate with your team before merging to your live documentation.

### Creating pull requests

Create a pull request from the editor when you're ready to publish your changes. See [Publishing changes](/editor/publish) for detailed steps on creating pull requests.

### Reviewing pull requests

Review pull requests in your Git provider (GitHub or GitLab):

1. Open the pull request link from the editor
2. Review the changes in the **Files changed** tab
3. Leave comments on specific lines or the overall PR
4. Request changes if updates are needed
5. Approve the PR when satisfied with the changes

### Responding to feedback

When reviewers request changes:

1. Return to the editor with your branch selected
2. Make the requested changes
3. Save your changes - they automatically push to the existing PR
4. Respond to review comments in your Git provider
5. Request re-review when ready

### Merging pull requests

Merge your pull request when:

- All requested changes are addressed
- The PR is approved by required reviewers
- Any automated checks have passed

Merge the PR in your Git provider. Your changes deploy to your live documentation site after merging.

## Preview deployments

Preview deployments create temporary URLs where you can see your changes before they go live.

### Accessing preview deployments

1. Click **Share** in the editor top bar
2. Click **Preview** to open the preview deployment in a new tab
3. The preview URL shows your documentation with all saved changes applied

### Sharing previews

Share preview deployments to gather feedback:

- Copy the preview URL from the Share panel
- Send the URL to team members or stakeholders
- Previews update automatically when you save changes

### Preview authentication

Preview URLs are publicly accessible by default. Enable preview authentication in your [dashboard addons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) to restrict access to authenticated organization members.

### Preview updates

Preview deployments update automatically when you save changes in the editor. Updates may take a moment to appear.

## Team permissions

Control who can access and edit your documentation through role-based permissions.

- **Editors**: Can access the editor and make changes
- **Reviewers**: Can review and approve pull requests
- **Viewers**: Can view documentation but not make changes

Configure team permissions in your [dashboard settings](/dashboard/permissions). Invite team members from your dashboard to give them access to your documentation.
