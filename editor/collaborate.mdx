Collaborate with your team on documentation using branch-based workflows, pull requests, and preview deployments.

If you aren't familiar with Git, see [Git essentials for the web editor](/editor/git-essentials).

## Branch-based collaboration

Use branches to work on documentation updates in parallel without affecting your live site.

### Why use branches

- **Isolate changes**: Work on updates without affecting your live documentation.
- **Review before publishing**: Get feedback from team members before changes go live.
- **Parallel work**: Multiple team members can work on different branches simultaneously.

## Recommended workflow

Use pull requests to propose changes and collaborate with your team before merging to your live documentation. This workflow ensures your team reviews changes before publishing and maintains a clear history of updates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a pull request">
    Create a pull request from the editor when you're ready to publish your changes. See <a href="/editor/publish">Publish changes in the web editor</a> for more information on using pull requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review pull requests">
    Review pull requests in your Git provider like GitHub or GitLab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond to feedback">
    When reviewers request changes, make the requested changes and save your changes. Additional changes automatically push to the existing pull request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge pull requests">
    Merge your pull request after addressing all requested changes, required reviewers approve the pull request, and any automated checks pass.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Preview deployments

Preview deployments create temporary URLs where you can see your rendered changes before they go live. Use preview deployments to gather feedback on how changes.

Every time you save changes to a branch, the preview deployment updates automatically.

### Access preview deployments

1. Click **Publish** in the editor tool bar.
2. Click the preview URL open the preview deployment in a new tab. The URL format is `organization-branch-name.mintlify.app`.

  <img src="/images/editor/share-preview-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" alt="Share button in the editor toolbar" />
</Frame>

### Share previews

Share the preview deployment URL with team members to gather feedback. Previews update automatically when you save additional changes.

### Preview authentication

Preview URLs are publicly accessible by default. Enable preview authentication in the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard to restrict access to authenticated organization members.

## Comment on documentation

Add comments to documentation pages to discuss changes, ask questions, and provide feedback to your team. Comments help you collaborate asynchronously and keep discussions organized by file.

### Add comments

1. Select text in the editor or click where you want to add a comment.
2. Click the comment icon or use the keyboard shortcut to open the comment panel.
3. Type your comment or suggested text change.
4. Click **Post** to add the comment.

Comments appear as threads in the editor sidebar, grouped by file. Team members can reply to comments to continue the discussion.

### View and manage comments

Open the comments panel in the editor sidebar to see all comments on the current branch. Comments are organized by file and show:

- The author's name
- A preview of the comment text
- The file location

Click a comment to jump to its location in the editor. Resolve comments when the discussion is complete or the issue is addressed.

### Comments in pull requests

Unresolved comments automatically sync to your GitHub pull request description after a short delay (approximately 5 seconds). The pull request description includes:

- A summary of unresolved threads and participating users
- Comments grouped by file
- Direct links back to the editor to view and respond to each comment

This sync happens automatically when you create or update comments, keeping your pull request description up to date with ongoing discussions. The sync is debounced to avoid excessive updates.

<Tip>
  Click the editor links in your pull request description to jump directly to the comment thread in the editor.
</Tip>

## Share editor links

Share a direct link to a specific page in the editor with your teammates. Use editor links to collaborate on updates and make changes to pages.

When you open a page, the editor saves the path in the URL. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar to share it with teammates who have access to the editor.

The URL format is: `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/{org}/{project}/editor/{branch}?file={filepath}`

For example, `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/acme/docs/editor/main?file=guides/quickstart.mdx` opens `quickstart.mdx` on the `main` branch.

Anyone with access to your Mintlify organization can use the link to open the file directly in the editor.

<Tip>
  When you share a page, tell people which branch you're working on so they can confirm they view the correct version.
