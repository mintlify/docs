title: "Publishing your changes"
description: "Deploy your documentation updates directly to production or through pull requests"

How your changes are published depends on which branch you are working on:

* **Deployment branch**: Publishing updates your live site immediately.
* **Other branches**: Publishing creates a pull request so you can review changes before they are deployed to production.

## Pull requests and reviewing changes

Pull requests let you propose changes from your branch so that other people can review them before merging into your live documentation. This helps ensure that your changes are correct and gives your team a chance to collaborate on content.

<Tip>
  Even if you're working solo, pull requests are valuable for previewing changes and maintaining a clear history of updates.
