The web editor offers two publishing paths depending on which branch you're working on: direct publishing to your live site or pull request workflows for review.

## Publishing workflows

### Direct publishing (deployment branch)
When working on your deployment branch (usually `main`):

1. Make your changes in the editor
2. Select **Publish** in the top-right corner  
3. Your changes deploy immediately to your live documentation site

**Use this for**: Quick fixes, typos, and urgent updates when you're confident in your changes.

### Pull request workflow (feature branches)  
When working on any other branch:

1. Make and save your changes
2. Select **Publish Pull Request**
3. Add a title and description for review
4. Create the pull request for team review
5. Merge when approved to deploy to your live site

**Use this for**: New features, major content updates, and collaborative work that benefits from review.

## Creating a pull request

When you're ready to publish changes from a feature branch:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save your work">
    Make sure all your changes are saved on your branch using **Save Changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the pull request">
    Select **Publish Pull Request** in the top-right corner of the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add context">
    Write a clear title and description explaining:
    - What changes you made
    - Why you made them  
    - Any specific areas that need review
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and share">
    Select **Publish Pull Request**. The editor will provide a link to view your pull request in GitHub or GitLab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Review and approval process

### For reviewers
Once a pull request is created:

1. **Review changes**: Check the diff in GitHub or GitLab to see exactly what changed
2. **Test locally**: Pull the branch locally if you want to test changes  
3. **Leave feedback**: Add comments or request changes if needed
4. **Approve**: Approve the pull request when you're satisfied with the changes

### For authors  
After creating your pull request:

1. **Address feedback**: Make additional changes in the web editor if reviewers request them
2. **Update automatically**: Saving changes in the editor automatically updates your pull request
3. **Merge when ready**: Once approved, merge your pull request to deploy changes

<Tip>
  Even if you're working solo, pull requests are valuable for previewing changes and maintaining a clear history of updates.
</Tip>

## Best practices

### Writing good pull request descriptions
- Explain the **why** behind your changes, not just the what
- Include screenshots for visual changes
- List any breaking changes or considerations for reviewers
- Reference related issues or tickets if applicable

### Choosing the right workflow
- **Direct publish** for: Typo fixes, minor updates, emergency changes
- **Pull requests** for: New content, restructuring, collaborative work, experimental features

### Managing multiple changes
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix
- Create separate branches for unrelated changes
- Merge or close old pull requests before starting new major work

## Troubleshooting publishing

**Changes not appearing**: Check your deployment status in the Mintlify dashboard and try hard refreshing your browser.

**Permission errors**: Verify you have the correct repository access and that your Git integration is properly configured.

**Merge conflicts**: If someone else changed the same content, you may need to resolve conflicts in your Git provider before merging.
