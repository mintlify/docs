### Image configuration

Configure images using configuration sheets:

1. Right-click an image in the media manager
2. Select **Configure**
3. Edit properties:
   - Alt text for accessibility
   - File path
   - Display settings

See [Configurations](/editor/configurations) for details on configuration sheets.

### Managing file paths

Images use paths relative to your documentation root:

- `/images/example.png` - Image in the images folder
- `/assets/logo.svg` - Logo in the assets folder

Edit file paths in the configuration sheet to move or rename assets.

## Best practices

- **Optimize images**: Compress images before uploading to reduce file sizes
- **Use descriptive names**: Name files clearly (like `api-dashboard-light.png` instead of `img1.png`)
- **Add alt text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO
- **Organize folders**: Group related assets in folders for easier management
- **Use appropriate formats**: PNG for graphics with transparency, JPG for photos, SVG for icons and logos
