## Add assets

Drag and drop media from your computer on to a page when the editor is in visual mode. Files save to the root of your `images/` folder.

### Upload files

In the assets manager, upload or search for a media file. Then drag and drop the file onto a page.

</Frame>

## Best practices

- **Use descriptive names**: Name files clearly. For example, `api-dashboard-light.png` instead of `img1.png`.
- **Add alt text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.
- **Organize folders**: Group related assets in folders for easier management.
- **Use appropriate formats**: PNG for graphics with transparency, JPG for photos, SVG for icons and logos.
