## Best practices

- **Use descriptive names**: Name files clearly, like `api-dashboard-light.png` instead of `img1.png`.
- **Add alt text**: Provide descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.
- **Organize with folders**: Group related assets, such as light and dark mode variants or assets for a specific feature area.
- **Use appropriate formats**: PNG for graphics with transparency, JPG for photos, SVG for icons and logos.
