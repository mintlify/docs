## Add media to a page

### Slash command

Type <kbd>/image</kbd> to open the image menu, then upload a new image or select an existing one.

### Upload files

Use the asset manager in the sidebar to upload or search for files.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/assets-light.png" alt="Assets manager selected in the editor sidebar menu." className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/assets-dark.png" alt="Assets manager selected in the editor sidebar menu." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Click **Upload** in the asset manager to add files from your computer.

## Manage assets

### Organize with folders

Click the **+** button in the file explorer to create a new folder. Drag and drop files and folders in the file tree to reorganize them.

### Rename and edit assets

Hover over an asset and click the **...** button to rename the file or update its alt text.

### Delete assets

Hover over an asset and click the <Icon icon="trash" /> delete button.

## Best practices

- **Use descriptive names**: Name files clearly, like `api-dashboard-light.png` instead of `img1.png`.
- **Add alt text**: Provide descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.
- **Organize with folders**: Group related assets, such as light and dark mode variants or assets for a specific feature area.
- **Use appropriate formats**: PNG for graphics with transparency, JPG for photos, SVG for icons and logos.
