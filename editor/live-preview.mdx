Preview your documentation site as you edit. Live preview shows your pages exactly as they appear when published, updating in real time as you make changes to content, navigation, and configuration.

## Open live preview

Click the <Icon icon="play" /> button in the toolbar to open a live preview in a new tab.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-light.png"
    alt="Live preview button on the editor toolbar."
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-dark.png"
    alt="Live preview button on the editor toolbar."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Live preview is only available for public documentation. If your documentation requires authentication, the editor displays a "Live preview unavailable" message.
