Preview your documentation site as you edit. Live preview shows your pages exactly as they appear when published, updating in real time as you make changes to content, navigation, and configuration.

## Open live preview

Click the <Icon icon="play" /> button in the toolbar to open a live preview in a separate browser window.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-light.png"
    alt="Live preview button on the editor toolbar."
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-dark.png"
    alt="Live preview button on the editor toolbar."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

The preview window opens alongside your editor, allowing you to see changes in real time as you edit. The preview is local only and requires an active editor session to function.

<Note>
  Live preview is only available for public documentation. If your documentation requires authentication, the editor displays a "Live preview unavailable" message.

## Live preview versus preview deployments

| | Live preview | Preview deployment |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Speed** | Instant | Requires build time |
| **Access** | In the editor | Shareable URL |
| **Use case** | View changes while editing | Share with team for review |
| **Availability** | While the editor is open | As long as the branch exists |

Use live preview for immediate feedback as you work. Create preview deployments when you need to share changes with your team or test on different devices.
