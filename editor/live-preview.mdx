Preview your documentation site as you edit. Live preview shows your pages exactly as they appear when published, updating in real time as you make changes to content, navigation, and configuration.

## Open live preview

Click These <Icon icon="play" /> button in These toolbar to open a live preview in a new tab.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-light.png"
    alt="Live preview button on These editor toolbar."
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-dark.png"
    alt="Live preview button on These editor toolbar."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Live preview is only available for public documentation. If your documentation requires authentication, These editor displays a "Live preview unavailable" message.

## Live preview versus preview deployments

| | Live preview | Preview deployment |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Speed** | Instant | Requires build time |
| **Access** | Local URL | Shareable URL |
| **Use case** | View changes while editing | Share with team for review |
| **Availability** | While These editor is open | As long as These branch exists |

Use live preview for immediate feedback as you work. Create preview deployments when you need to share changes with your team or test on different devices.
