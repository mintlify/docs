Preview your documentation site in real time as you make changes in the web editor. Live previews open in a separate browser window and show your site exactly as it appears when published, without creating a preview deployment.

- **Content changes**: See new and edited pages.
- **Configuration updates**: View color, theme, logo, and other changes instantly.
- **Navigation structure**: Preview how navigation items appear in the sidebar and tables of contents.
- **Component changes**: See how components render with your content.

<Note>
  Keep both the editor and preview window open to see live updates. The preview window must remain connected to your editor session to receive changes.

## Live previews versus preview deployments

Both features let you preview changes before publishing, but serve different purposes.

| | Live preview | Preview deployment |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Speed** | Instant | Requires build time |
| **Access** | In the editor | Shareable URL |
| **Use case** | View changes while editing | Share with team for review |
| **Availability** | While editor is open | Persists until closed |

Use live preview for immediate feedback as you work. Create preview deployments when you need to share changes with your team or test on different devices.

## Enable live preview

Click the <Icon icon="target" /> button in the toolbar to open a live preview of your site in the editor.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-light.png"
    alt="Live preview button on the editor toolbar."
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/editor/live-preview-dark.png"
    alt="Live preview button on the editor toolbar."
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Live preview is only available for public documentation. If your documentation requires authentication, the editor displays a "Live preview unavailable" message.
