Branches let you work on changes without affecting your live documentation site. When your changes are ready, you can merge them into your deployment branch through a pull request.

## Why use branches

**Best practice: Always work from branches.** This approach:

- Keeps your live documentation stable while you make changes
- Enables proper review workflows with your team
- Creates a clear history of what changed and when
- Allows you to experiment safely with new content or structure

Even if you're working solo, branches are valuable for previewing changes before they go live.

## Creating a branch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the branch selector">
    Select the branch name in the editor toolbar (usually `main` by default).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new branch">
    Select **New Branch** from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your branch">
    Enter a descriptive name like:
    - `update-getting-started`
    - `fix-installation-steps`  
    - `add-api-examples`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and switch">
    Select **Create Branch**. The editor will switch to your new branch automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If the editor doesn't automatically switch to your new branch, select it manually from the branch dropdown.
</Note>

## Saving changes on a branch

When you're working on a branch:

1. Make your edits in visual mode or Markdown mode
2. Select the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a commit with your changes and pushes it to your branch

Your changes are now saved but not yet live on your documentation site.

## Switching between branches

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open branch selector">
    Select the current branch name in the editor toolbar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose target branch">
    Select the branch you want to switch to from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Any unsaved changes will be lost when switching branches. Make sure to save your work first by selecting **Save Changes**.
</Tip>

## Branch types

### Deployment branch
Your main branch (often called `main`) contains your live documentation content. Changes to this branch are automatically published to your documentation site immediately.

### Feature branches
Any branch other than your deployment branch. Use these for:
- New feature documentation
- Content updates and revisions  
- Experimental changes
- Collaborative work that needs review

Changes on feature branches require a pull request to merge into your deployment branch.

## Best practices

- **Use descriptive branch names** that explain what you're working on
- **Keep branches focused** on a single task or feature
- **Save frequently** to avoid losing work when switching branches
- **Delete branches** after merging to keep your repository clean
- **Communicate with your team** about which branches are active
