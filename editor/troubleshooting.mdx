## "You don't have write access to this repo"

This error appears when your authorized GitHub account doesn't have write access to the documentation repository, even if you have full permissions in the Mintlify dashboard.

**Solutions:**

1. **Get repository write access**: Ask your GitHub admin to grant your GitHub account write (push) access to the documentation repository.

2. **Unauthorize your GitHub account**: Remove your GitHub authorization in your [account settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account). The Mintlify GitHub App will sign commits on your behalf instead.

<Warning>
  If you unauthorize your GitHub account, commits won't be attributed to your GitHub profile.
</Warning>
