Create and edit documentation directly in your browser with the web editor. Work on content visually to see real-time previews or in Markdown; manage your site structure with drag-and-drop components; and publish changes using Git workflows.

## Key features

- **Visual and Markdown editing**: Switch between visual and Markdown modes as you work.
- **Live preview**: See real-time changes as you edit without creating preview deployments.
- **Visual navigation editing**: Configure your navigation structure and see how your site's sidebar looks directly in the editor.
- **Drag-and-drop navigation**: Organize your site structure visually without editing configuration files.
- **Configuration options**: Adjust all site configuration options from the editor without manually editing your `docs.json`.
- **Built-in media manager**: Upload and organize images and assets with drag-and-drop support.
- **Unused files section**: View and manage pages that aren't in your navigation with drag-and-drop support to add them.
- **Git synchronization**: All changes sync automatically with your documentation repository.
- **Branch workflows**: Work on feature branches and create pull requests for review.
- **Shareable preview links**: Share preview deployments directly from the editor toolbar.
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple team members can work simultaneously with preview deployments.
- **No GitHub sign-in required**: Work in the web editor without connecting a GitHub account.
