Create and edit documentation directly in your browser with the web editor. Work on content visually to see real-time previews or in Markdown; manage your site structure with drag-and-drop components; and publish changes using Git workflows.

## Key features

- **Visual and Markdown editing**: Switch between visual and Markdown modes as you work.
- **Drag-and-drop navigation**: Organize your site structure visually without editing configuration files.
- **Built-in media manager**: Upload and organize images and assets.
- **Git synchronization**: All changes sync automatically with your documentation repository.
- **Branch workflows**: Work on feature branches and create pull requests for review.
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple team members can work simultaneously with preview deployments.
