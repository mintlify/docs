The web editor lets you create and edit documentation directly in your browser without any local setup. Edit content in visual or Markdown mode, manage your site navigation with drag-and-drop, organize media assets, and publish changes—all with automatic Git synchronization.

## Key capabilities

- **Visual editing**: Edit content in visual mode with real-time preview, or switch to Markdown mode for direct MDX access
- **Navigation management**: Organize your site structure with drag-and-drop in the visual navigation tree
- **Media management**: Upload and organize images and assets with the built-in media manager
- **Git integration**: All changes automatically sync with your Git repository
- **Branch workflows**: Create branches, switch between them, and manage your development workflow
- **Pull requests**: Create and update pull requests directly from the editor
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on documentation simultaneously
- **Zero setup**: Start editing immediately from your dashboard with no local environment required

## Prerequisites

Before using the web editor, you need:

- Active Mintlify account
- Connected Git repository (GitHub or GitLab)
- Appropriate [permissions](/dashboard/permissions) to edit documentation

## Accessing the editor

Access the web editor from your [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com):

1. Sign in to your dashboard
2. Select your documentation project
3. Click **Editor** in the navigation

The editor opens in your browser with your documentation repository loaded.

## Understanding the interface

The web editor interface has four main areas:

### Left panel

The left panel contains three tabs for managing different aspects of your documentation:

- **Files**: Browse and search all files in your repository. Use this to navigate your documentation structure and open files for editing.
- **Navigation**: Manage your site's navigation structure with drag-and-drop. Add pages to your sidebar, create groups, and organize your documentation hierarchy.
- **Media**: Upload and organize images, videos, and other assets. Create folders and manage your media library.

Switch between tabs by clicking the icons at the top of the left panel.

### Editor area

The center area is where you edit content:

- **Content editor**: Edit your documentation files in visual or Markdown mode
- **Mode toggle**: Switch between visual and Markdown mode using the toggle in the toolbar

### Preview panel

When available, the right panel shows a live preview of your documentation as it will appear when published. Changes update in real-time as you edit.

### Top bar

The top bar contains controls for saving and publishing:

- **Branch selector**: Choose which branch you're working on or create a new branch
- **Save/Publish**: Save changes to your branch or publish to your live documentation
- **Share**: Access preview deployments and share links with your team

## Choosing your branch

Use the branch selector in the top bar to choose which branch you're working on.

### Deployment branch vs feature branches

- **Deployment branch**: The branch that publishes to your live documentation site (typically `main` or `master`). Changes to this branch go live when published.
- **Feature branches**: Separate branches for working on updates before they go live. Use feature branches to preview changes and collaborate on updates before publishing.

### Creating a new branch

To create a new branch:

1. Click the branch selector in the top bar
2. Click **Create new branch**
3. Enter a branch name
4. Select which branch to create from (typically your deployment branch)

### Switching branches

To switch between branches, click the branch selector and choose the branch you want to work on. If you have unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to save or discard them before switching.

## Editor modes

The web editor supports two editing modes. Switch between them using the mode toggle in the toolbar.

### Visual mode

Visual mode provides a WYSIWYG editing experience where you see your documentation as it will appear when published:

- Edit text and format content with the formatting toolbar
- Press `/` to open the component menu and add callouts, code blocks, tabs, and other components
- Add and configure components visually without writing MDX syntax

Visual mode works best for quick content updates and when you want to see how your changes will look in real-time.

### Markdown mode

Markdown mode gives you direct access to your MDX and Markdown files:

- Edit the raw MDX/Markdown source
- Syntax highlighting helps you write and read code
- Full control over component properties and advanced configurations
- Copy and paste MDX content from other sources

Markdown mode works best when you need precise control over component properties or prefer writing in MDX syntax.

### Switching between modes

Your changes are preserved when switching between visual and Markdown mode. The mode toggle is always available in the editor toolbar.
