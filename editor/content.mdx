Create and edit documentation pages using the file tree and content editor.

## Navigating files

### File tree

Browse your documentation files in the **Files** tab of the left panel:

- Expand folders to see their contents
- Click a file to open it in the editor
- Use folder icons to expand or collapse directories

### File search

Quickly find files using the file search:

1. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Windows)
2. Type the file name or path
3. Select the file from the results

### File tree vs navigation tree

- **File tree**: Shows all files in your repository
- **Navigation tree**: Shows pages included in your site's navigation

Not all files appear in navigation. Use the navigation tree to add files to your site's sidebar.

## Creating new pages

Create documentation pages from the file tree:

1. Click the **+** button in the Files tab
2. Select **New file**
3. Choose the file location
4. Enter a file name (`.mdx` extension is added automatically)
5. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to create

### File types

Choose the file type when creating files:

- **.mdx**: MDX files with support for React components (default)
- **.md**: Standard Markdown files
- **Other**: Create other file types like JSON or CSS

## Editing content

### Visual mode

Edit content visually with real-time preview:

- **Type directly**: Edit text as it will appear
- **Format text**: Use the toolbar to bold, italicize, and format text
- **Add components**: Press <kbd>/</kbd> to open the component menu
- **Insert links**: Select text and press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>
- **Add images**: Use the image component from the <kbd>/</kbd> menu

Available components include callouts, code blocks, tabs, accordions, and more. See the [Components documentation](/components) for the complete list.

### Markdown mode

Edit the raw MDX source:

- **Direct MDX editing**: Write MDX and Markdown syntax directly
- **Syntax highlighting**: Code is highlighted for readability
- **Component properties**: Set component props and advanced configurations
- **Frontmatter**: Edit page metadata at the top of the file

See [Format text](/create/text) and [Format code](/create/code) for MDX syntax reference.

### Switching modes

Switch between visual and Markdown mode using the toggle in the toolbar. Your changes are preserved when switching.

## Page metadata

Configure page properties using configuration sheets:

1. Right-click a page in the file tree
2. Select **Configure**
3. Edit metadata:
   - Title and description
   - Icon and display mode
   - SEO settings

See [Configurations](/editor/configurations) for details on available properties.

## Managing files

### Renaming files

Rename files to update their paths:

1. Right-click the file
2. Select **Rename**
3. Enter the new name
4. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save

File paths in navigation and cross-references update automatically.

### Moving files

Move files between folders using drag and drop:

1. Select the file in the file tree
2. Drag it to the destination folder
3. Drop to move

### Duplicating pages

Duplicate pages to create similar content:

1. Right-click the file
2. Select **Duplicate**
3. The duplicated file is created with a numbered suffix

Use duplication as a starting point for pages with similar structure.

### Deleting files

Delete files you no longer need:

1. Right-click the file
2. Select **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

Deleted files are removed from the repository and cannot be recovered from the editor.
