Organize your documentation structure using the visual navigation tree.

## Understanding navigation

### How navigation works

The navigation tree controls your documentation sidebar—the menu users see when browsing your docs. Pages must be added to navigation to appear in your site's sidebar.

### Navigation tree vs file tree

- **File tree**: Shows all files in your repository
- **Navigation tree**: Shows only pages included in your site navigation

Files can exist without being in navigation. Add files to navigation to make them visible to users.

### Docs.json mapping

Visual changes in the navigation tree map directly to your `docs.json` configuration file. The editor handles the JSON structure automatically. See [Navigation reference](/organize/navigation) for the complete navigation schema.

## Accessing the navigation tree

Access the navigation tree from the left panel:

1. Click the **Navigation** tab in the left panel
2. View your site's navigation structure
3. Expand groups to see nested pages

## Adding pages to navigation

Add pages to make them visible in your documentation sidebar:

1. Click the **+** button in the navigation tree
2. Select **Add page**
3. Choose an existing file or create a new page
4. The page appears in navigation

New pages are added to the end of the current navigation level.

## Organizing navigation

### Reordering pages

Reorder pages using drag and drop:

1. Click and hold a page in the navigation tree
2. Drag it to the new position
3. Drop to reorder

Visual feedback shows where the page will be placed.

### Creating groups

Organize pages into groups:

1. Click the **+** button in the navigation tree
2. Select **Add group**
3. Enter a group name
4. Add pages to the group

Groups help organize related documentation pages together.

### Nesting groups

Create nested groups for hierarchical organization:

1. Drag a group onto another group
2. Drop to nest
3. Groups can be nested multiple levels deep

Use nested groups to organize complex documentation structures.

### Expanding and collapsing groups

Control the default state of groups:

1. Right-click a group
2. Select **Configure**
3. Toggle **Expanded by default**

This sets whether users see the group expanded or collapsed when they visit your documentation.

## Navigation actions

Access actions for navigation items:

1. Right-click a page or group
2. Choose an action:
   - **Configure**: Open configuration sheet
   - **Duplicate**: Create a copy
   - **Hide**: Hide from navigation without deleting
   - **Delete**: Remove from navigation

### Hiding pages

Hide pages to keep them in your repository but remove them from navigation:

1. Right-click the page
2. Select **Hide**

Hidden pages remain in your file tree but don't appear in the sidebar.

## Configuring navigation elements

Configure navigation properties using configuration sheets:

1. Right-click a navigation item
2. Select **Configure**
3. Edit properties:
   - **Pages**: Title, description, icon
   - **Groups**: Name, icon, tag, expanded state
   - **Links**: Text, URL, icon

See [Configurations](/editor/configurations) for details on available configuration options.

### Adding icons

Add icons to pages and groups:

1. Open the configuration sheet
2. Click the icon field
3. Search for an icon from the [Lucide icon library](https://lucide.dev)
4. Select the icon

### Adding tags

Add tags like "NEW" or "BETA" to highlight navigation items:

1. Open the configuration sheet
2. Enter a tag in the tag field
3. The tag appears next to the item in navigation

## Advanced navigation

The navigation tree supports advanced features:

- **External links**: Add links to external resources
- **Tabs**: Create tabbed navigation at the top level
- **Anchors**: Link to external sites
- **Dropdowns**: Organize related links

See [Navigation reference](/organize/navigation) for details on these navigation types and their configuration.

## Best practices

- **Keep navigation shallow**: Limit nesting to 2-3 levels for easier browsing
- **Use descriptive names**: Name groups and pages clearly
- **Group related content**: Organize pages by topic or feature area
- **Add icons sparingly**: Use icons to highlight important sections, not every item
- **Order by user journey**: Place getting started content first, advanced topics later
