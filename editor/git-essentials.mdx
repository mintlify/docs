Git lets you control and track changes to files. With Git, you cansee what changed over time in files, who made the changes, when they made changes, and why. You can undo changes and go back to previous versions of files if you need to. All of these capabilities combine to make Git the version control system of choice for docs-as-code workflows where you manage documentation the same way you would any other codebase.

The web editor handles Git operations for you. Understanding a few key concepts helps you get the most out of the editor and collaborate with your team.

## What Git does for your docs

Git tracks every change made to your documentation. It records what changed, who changed it, and when. This means you can:

- See the full history of any page.
- Undo changes by reverting to a previous version.
- Work on updates without affecting your live site.
- Review changes before they go live.

Your documentation repository is the collection of files, and their history, that make up your documentation site. The web editor connects to this repository to read and update your content.

## Key concepts

These are the Git concepts you'll encounter most often when using the web editor.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commit">
    A saved snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time. Each commit includes a message describing what changed and creates a permanent record in your project history.

    When you save changes, the web editor creates a commit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Branch">
    A separate line of work in your repository. Sometimes called a **feature branch**.
    
    Your live documentation builds from a **deployment branch**, usually called `main`. Other branches let you work on changes independently. Nothing on a branch affects your live site until you merge it into your deployment branch with a pull request.

    When you create a branch, the web editor creates a new branch in your repository. You can switch between branches from the branch dropdown in the toolbar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deployment branch">
    The branch that builds your live documentation site, typically called `main`. Changes merged into this branch automatically deploy to your site.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pull request">
    A proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. Pull requests let your team review and discuss changes before they go live.

    When you publish changes on a feature branch, the web editor creates a pull request. Your team reviews and merges the pull request in your Git provider (GitHub or GitLab).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Merge">
    Combining changes from one branch into another. After your team reviews and approves a pull request, merging the branch incorporates your changes into the deployment branch and publishes them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflict">
    Occurs when two people change the same part of a file differently. The editor helps resolve any conflicts that occur on your branches.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Diff">
    A comparison showing the differences between two versions of a file. When reviewing pull requests, diffs highlight exactly what changed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How the editor maps to Git

Every action you take in the web editor corresponds to a Git operation.

| Your action in the editor | Git operation behind the scenes |
|---|---|
| Open a file | Fetch the latest version from your repository |
| Save changes | Create a **commit**, a snapshot of your changes in the project history |
| Create a branch | Create a **branch**, a separate line of work that doesn't affect your live site unless you choose to publish it |
| Publish on your main branch | Push your commit directly, which triggers a deployment |
| Publish on a feature branch | Create a **pull request**, a proposal to merge your changes into the main branch |
