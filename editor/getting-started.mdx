The web editor is a visual interface for creating, editing, and reviewing documentation directly in your browser. No local setup requiredâ€”just log in to your dashboard and start writing.

## What you can do

- **Visual editing**: Make changes using a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor that shows how your content will look when published
- **Git synchronization**: All changes automatically sync with your Git repository to maintain version control
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on documentation simultaneously
- **Component integration**: Add callouts, code blocks, and other Mintlify components with a simple `/` command

## Your first editing session

Follow this walkthrough to make your first changes in the web editor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your branch">
    Create a branch or make changes directly to your deployment branch. For your first time, we recommend creating a branch to keep your live docs safe while you learn.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your file">
    Navigate to an existing file in the sidebar or create a new one using the file explorer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your content">
    Make changes in the web editor. Try switching between visual mode and Markdown mode using the toggle in the top-right corner to see which you prefer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview your changes">
    Visual mode shows you exactly how your changes will appear on your live site. Use this to verify everything looks correct.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your changes">
    If you're working on your deployment branch, your changes go live immediately. On other branches, you'll create a pull request for review before publishing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor modes

The web editor offers two editing experiences. Switch between them anytime using the toggle in the editor toolbar:

  <img 
    src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-light.png" 
    alt="Mode toggle icons highlighted in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png" 
    alt="Mode toggle icons highlighted in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Visual mode

Perfect for beginners and quick edits. What you see in the editor is exactly what appears on your documentation site. Press `/` to open the component menu and add content blocks, callouts, and code snippets.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/visual-mode-light.png" 
    alt="Visual editing mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/visual-mode-dark.png" 
    alt="Visual editing mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Markdown mode

Gives you direct access to the underlying MDX code. Use this when you need precise control over component properties or prefer writing in Markdown syntax.

  <img 
    src="/images/editor/markdown-mode-light.png" 
    alt="Markdown mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/markdown-mode-dark.png" 
    alt="Markdown mode in the Mintlify Web Editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>
