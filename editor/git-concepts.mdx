The web editor handles Git operations automatically, but understanding these concepts will help you work more effectively and collaborate better with team members using local development environments.

## Core Git concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository">
    Your documentation's source where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your repository to access and modify content. Think of it as the master database for all your documentation files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit">
    A saved snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time. Each commit includes a message describing what changed and creates a permanent record in your project history.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Branch">
    A separate workspace for making changes without affecting your live documentation. Think of it as a safe sandbox for experiments and larger updates where you can work on features independently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deployment branch">
    The main branch that contains your live documentation content. Changes to this branch are automatically published to your documentation site. Often called `main` or `master`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pull request">
    A way to propose merging your branch changes into your live documentation. Allows for review and discussion before changes go live. Also called a merge request in GitLab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Diff">
    Shows the specific changes between two versions of a file. When reviewing pull requests, diffs highlight what has been added, removed, or modified, making it easy to see exactly what changed.

## How the web editor uses Git

The web editor connects to your Git repository through the [GitHub App](/settings/github) or [GitLab integration](/settings/gitlab) and automates common Git operations:

### Automatic operations

**When you open a file**: The editor fetches the latest version from your repository, ensuring you're always working with current content.

**When you make changes**: The editor tracks your modifications as a draft that can become a commit when you're ready to save.

**When you save changes**: Creates a commit with your changes and a descriptive message, preserving your work in the project history.

**When you create a branch**: Sets up a new branch in your repository for isolated development work.

**When you publish**: Either commits directly to your deployment branch (immediate publishing) or creates a pull request (review workflow).

### Behind the scenes

The web editor abstracts away complex Git commands while maintaining all the benefits of version control:

- **Version history**: Every change is tracked with timestamps and descriptions
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Rollback capability**: Previous versions are always recoverable
- **Branch isolation**: Experimental changes don't affect live content

## Why Git matters for documentation

### Version control benefits
- **Track changes**: See exactly what changed, when, and why
- **Collaborate safely**: Multiple team members can contribute without overwriting each other's work  
- **Rollback protection**: Easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of who made what changes

### Collaborative workflows
- **Review process**: Pull requests enable team members to review changes before they go live
- **Parallel development**: Different team members can work on different features simultaneously
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with developer workflows and CI/CD pipelines

## Git vs. traditional documentation tools

Unlike traditional documentation platforms, Git-based workflows provide:

- **Developer integration**: Your docs live alongside your code in familiar developer tools
- **Branching**: Safe experimentation without affecting live content
- **Merge conflicts**: Intelligent handling when multiple people edit the same content
- **External collaboration**: Contributors can propose changes even without direct access

## Best practices

### Commit messages
The web editor generates descriptive commit messages automatically, but understanding good commit practices helps when reviewing history:

- Be specific about what changed
- Explain why the change was made
- Keep messages concise but informative

### Branching strategy
- Use feature branches for new content or major updates
- Keep branches focused on specific tasks or features
- Merge regularly to avoid large, complex merges
- Delete branches after merging to keep the repository clean

### Collaboration
- Communicate with team members about active branches
- Review pull requests thoroughly before merging
- Pull latest changes before starting new work
- Use descriptive branch names that explain the work being done
