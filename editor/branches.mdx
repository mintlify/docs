Branches let you create separate instances of your documentation to make changes, get reviews, and try new approaches before publishing. Your team can work on branches to update different parts of your documentation at the same time without affecting what users see on your live site until you publish any changes.

We recommend always working from branches when updating documentation to keep your live site stable and enable review workflows.

## Creating a branch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the branch selector">
    Select the branch name in the editor toolbar (usually `main`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new branch">
    Select **New Branch** from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your branch">
    Use a descriptive name that explains what you're working on:
    - `update-getting-started`
    - `fix-api-examples`  
    - `restructure-navigation`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and switch">
    Select **Create Branch**. The editor switches to your new branch automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If the editor doesn't switch automatically, select your new branch from the dropdown menu.
</Note>

## Saving and switching

Save changes to your branch by selecting **Save Changes** in the top-right corner. This creates a commit and pushes your work to the branch.

To switch branches, select the current branch name in the toolbar and choose a different branch from the dropdown.

<Tip>
  Unsaved changes are lost when switching branches. Save your work first.
</Tip>

## Understanding branch types

**Deployment branch**: Your main branch (usually `main`) contains your live documentation. Changes here publish immediately to your site.

**Feature branches**: All other branches where you work on changes before they're ready to go live. These require a pull request to merge into your main branch.

## Working with your team

Name branches clearly so teammates understand what you're working on. Delete branches after merging to keep your repository organized. Let your team know when you're working on major changes that might affect their work.
