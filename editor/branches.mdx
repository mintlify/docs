Branches are a version control feature that let you create separate instances of your documentation, then merge into your main branch if you want to publish your changes. Think of a branch as a copy of your documentation where you can experiment, make edits, and test changes before they go live.

A benefit of branches is that your team can work simultaneously on seprate branches without getting in each other's way. Even if two different branches make changes to the same file, you will be required to resolve any conflicts before merging branches and publishing your docs updates.

If you decide that you don't want to publish changes from a branch, you can delete the branch with no consequences. This makes branch a safe place to experiment and try new approaches to your content.

We recommend that you always work from branches when you're updating your documentation. This ensures that your live site stays stable and enables review workflows for any updates.

## Creating a branch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the branch selector">
    Select the branch name in the editor toolbar (usually `main`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new branch">
    Select **New Branch** from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your branch">
    Use a descriptive name that explains what you're working on:
    - `update-getting-started`
    - `fix-api-examples`  
    - `restructure-navigation`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and switch">
    Select **Create Branch**. The editor switches to your new branch automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If the editor doesn't switch automatically, select your new branch from the dropdown menu.
</Note>

## Saving and switching

Save changes to your branch by selecting **Save Changes** in the top-right corner. This creates a commit and pushes your work to the branch.

To switch branches, select the current branch name in the toolbar and choose a different branch from the dropdown.

<Tip>
  Unsaved changes are lost when switching branches. Save your work first.
</Tip>

## Understanding branch types

**Deployment branch**: Your main branch (usually `main`) contains your live documentation. Changes here publish immediately to your site.

**Feature branches**: All other branches where you work on changes before they're ready to go live. These require a pull request to merge into your main branch.

## Working with your team

Name branches clearly so teammates understand what you're working on. Delete branches after merging to keep your repository organized. Let your team know when you're working on major changes that might affect their work.
