## Publishing workflows

The editor supports two workflows for publishing documentation updates. The workflow you use depends on your repository's branch protection rules and the branch you work on.

* **Create pull requests**: If your repository has a branch protection rule that requires pull requests before changes can merge into your deployment branch, the editor creates a pull request when you publish changes.
* **Publish directly**: If your repository has no branch protection rules, your changes merge to the deployment branch and deploy immediately when you publish.

| Branch type | Branch protection | Publishing workflow |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| <Tooltip headline="Deployment branch" tip="The branch that publishes to your live documentation site, typically 'main'.">Deployment branch</Tooltip> | None | Commits and deploys changes |
| Deployment branch | Pull requests required | Creates a pull request |
| <Tooltip headline="Feature branch" tip="An isolated branch where you work on updates before merging to your deployment branch.">Feature branch</Tooltip> | None | Merges changes to deployment branch and deploys changes |
| Feature branch | Pull requests required | Creates a pull request |

<Tip>
  Configure branch protection rules in your Git provider to require pull requests. See [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) in the GitHub docs or [Protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/branches/protected/) in the GitLab docs.

## Save changes

As you edit, the editor tracks your changes.

- New or deleted files.
- Content edits in pages.
- Navigation structure changes.
- Media uploads and organization.
- Configuration updates.

When you work on your deployment branch, your changes save automatically.

  <img src="/images/editor/toolbar-dark.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

When you work on a feature branch, you can save changes to the branch as <Tooltip headline="Commit" tip="A commit is a saved snapshot of your changes in Git.">commits</Tooltip>.

<Frame caption="Changes on a feature branch.">
<img src="/images/editor/toolbar-branch-light.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change and the Save as commit button on a feature branch." className="block dark:hidden" />
<img src="/images/editor/toolbar-branch-dark.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change and the Save as commit button on a feature branch." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

To discard changes, click **Undo changes** beside a file name in the **Changes** dropdown.

### Publish your changes

Click **Publish** in the toolbar. Depending on your workflow, your changes deploy immediately or create a pull request for you to merge in your Git provider. If you are on a feature branch, save your changes before publishing.

The **Publish** button is disabled when there are no pending changes or when a pull request for the current branch is already open.

## Resolve conflicts

Conflicts occur when your branch and the deployment branch have incompatible changes to the same files.

### What causes conflicts

Conflicts happen when:

- You and another team member edit the same lines in a file.
- Files are moved or deleted in one branch but modified in another.

### Resolve conflicts

The editor displays warnings when conflicts prevent operations like publishing or switching branches. To resolve conflicts, follow the instructions in the editor to choose which changes to keep.

## Commit signing

Sign commits with your GitHub account by authorizing it in your [account settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account). Without authorization, the Mintlify GitHub App signs commits made in the web editor.

Attributing commits to your account maintains an accurate history of who made changes to your documentation.
