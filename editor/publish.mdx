The publishing workflow depends on which branch you're working on and your repository's branch protection settings.

## Understanding the workflow

### Editor states

Your work progresses through three states in the editor:

- **Unsaved changes**: Edits you've made but haven't saved
- **Saved**: Changes saved to your branch but not yet published
- **Published**: Changes merged and deployed to your live documentation

### Branch types

- **Deployment branch**: The branch that publishes to your live documentation site (typically `main` or `master`)
- **Feature branches**: Separate branches for working on updates before they go live

### Publishing workflow

How your changes publish depends on branch protection:

| Branch type | Branch protection | What happens when you publish |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Deployment branch | None | Changes merge and go live immediately |
| Deployment branch | Pull requests required | Creates a pull request for review |
| Feature branch | None | Changes merge into deployment branch and go live immediately |
| Feature branch | Pull requests required | Creates a pull request for review |

<Tip>
Configure branch protection rules in your Git provider to require pull request reviews before merging. See [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) or [Protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/branches/protected/) for more information.
</Tip>

## Saving changes

Save your changes to your current branch before publishing.

### Manual save

Click **Save Changes** in the top bar to save all changes. The editor saves:

- Content edits in files
- Navigation structure changes
- Media uploads and organization
- Configuration updates

### Viewing changes

The editor shows indicators when you have unsaved or unpublished changes:

- Unsaved changes appear in the changes panel
- Modified files show indicators in the file tree
- The top bar displays your save and publish status

### Discarding changes

To discard unsaved changes:

1. Click the changes indicator
2. Select **Discard changes**
3. Confirm you want to discard

This reverts all unsaved edits since your last save.

## Publishing directly

When your deployment branch has no branch protection, you can publish changes directly to your live documentation.

### Publishing your changes

1. Save all changes with **Save Changes**
2. Click **Publish** in the top bar
3. Enter a commit message describing your changes
4. Click **Publish**

Your changes merge to the deployment branch and deploy to your live documentation site.

### Verifying changes are live

After publishing:

1. Check the deployment status in your dashboard
2. Visit your live documentation site
3. Verify your changes appear as expected

Deployments typically complete within a few minutes.

## Working with branches

### Creating a new branch

Create branches to work on changes before they go live:

1. Click the branch selector in the top bar
2. Click **Create new branch**
3. Enter a branch name (use descriptive names like `update-api-docs` or `fix-typo-homepage`)
4. Select the source branch (typically your deployment branch)
5. Click **Create**

The editor switches to your new branch.

### Switching branches

To switch between branches:

1. Click the branch selector in the top bar
2. Choose the branch you want to work on

If you have unsaved changes, the editor prompts you to save or discard them before switching.

### Syncing branches

The editor shows when your branch is ahead or behind the remote:

- **Ahead**: Your branch has local changes not yet pushed
- **Behind**: The remote branch has changes you don't have locally

Click **Sync** to push local changes and pull remote updates.

### Deleting branches

Delete branches after merging to keep your repository organized:

1. Switch to a different branch
2. Click the branch selector
3. Find the branch to delete
4. Click the delete icon
5. Confirm deletion

The editor warns you if the branch has unmerged changes.

## Creating pull requests

Use pull requests when branch protection requires review before merging, or when you want feedback on your changes.

### When to use pull requests

Pull requests are useful for:

- Getting review and approval before publishing
- Discussing changes with your team
- Maintaining a clear history of documentation updates
- Testing changes with preview deployments

### Creating a pull request

1. Save all changes with **Save Changes**
2. Click **Publish Pull Request** in the top bar
3. Enter a pull request title
4. Write a description explaining:
   - What changes you made
   - Why you made them
   - Any specific areas that need review
5. Click **Publish Pull Request**

The editor provides a link to view your pull request in your Git provider.

### Updating a pull request

To make additional changes to an existing pull request:

1. Make your changes in the editor
2. Click **Save Changes**

Your changes automatically push to the existing pull request. Team members reviewing the PR see the updates.

### Pull request previews

Pull requests automatically create preview deployments where you can see your changes before they go live. Access the preview URL from the Share panel in the editor.

See [Collaboration](/editor/collaboration) for details on sharing previews and working with your team.

## Handling conflicts

Conflicts occur when changes in your branch conflict with changes in the target branch.

### What causes conflicts

Conflicts happen when:

- You and another team member edit the same lines in a file
- Files are modified in both your branch and the target branch
- Files are moved or deleted in one branch but modified in another

### Conflict warnings

The editor displays warnings when conflicts prevent operations. Git won't allow you to merge or switch branches when conflicts exist.

### Resolving conflicts

When you encounter a conflict:

1. Review the conflicting changes in your Git provider
2. Resolve conflicts in your Git provider's conflict editor, or pull the branch locally to resolve
3. Commit the resolution
4. Return to the web editor to continue working

See [Git concepts](/guides/git-concepts) for more information on understanding and resolving conflicts.

## Git integration

### Commit signing

Sign commits with your GitHub account by authorizing it in your [account settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account). Without authorization, the Mintlify GitHub App signs commits made in the web editor.

### Commit attribution

Commits show your account as the author when you authorize your GitHub account. This maintains an accurate history of who made changes to your documentation.
