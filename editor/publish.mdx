## Publishing workflows

The editor supports two workflows for publishing documentation updates.

### Publish directly to your live site

If your repository has no branch protection rules, any changes that you publish immediately appear on your live site regardless of the branch you're working on. You can still use branches to keep changes isolated and share preview deployments for review.

Use direct publishing when:

- You do not need to review changes before publishing.
- You are the sole contributor to the documentation.

### Create pull requests

If your repository has branch protection rules, any changes that you publish create a pull request. Your team can review changes, give feedback, and make updates before merging a pull request to update your documentation site. Your site can only be updated by merging pull requests into your deployment branch via your Git provider.

Use a pull requests when:

- You want to review changes before publishing.
- Multiple people are working on documentation.

For collaboration workflows and team review processes, see [Collaborate](/editor/collaborate).

## Save changes

As you edit, the editor tracks your changes.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/toolbar-light.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change." className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/toolbar-dark.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>



Click **Save Changes** in the toolbar to commit your edits to the current branch. This saves:

- Content edits in files
- Navigation structure changes
- Media uploads and organization
- Configuration updates

Your changes are saved to the branch but not yet published to your live site.

**Discard changes:** Click **Undo changes** beside the file name to discard unsaved edits.

### Publish your changes

After saving changes to your branch, click **Publish** in the toolbar.

If your repository has branch protection rules requiring review, the editor creates a pull request. Team members can review your changes before they go live.

If there are no protection rules, your changes merge to the deployment branch and deploy immediately.

<Tip>
Configure branch protection rules in your Git provider to require pull requests. See [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) in the GitHub docs or [Protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/branches/protected/) in the GitLab docs.

## Resolve conflicts

Conflicts occur when your branch and the deployment branch have incompatible changes to the same files.

### What causes conflicts

Conflicts happen when:

- You and another team member edit the same lines in a file.
- Files are moved or deleted in one branch but modified in another.

### Resolve conflicts

The editor displays warnings when conflicts prevent operations like publishing or switching branches. To resolve conflicts, follow the instructions in the editor to choose which changes to keep.

## Commit signing

Sign commits with your GitHub account by authorizing it in your [account settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account). Without authorization, the Mintlify GitHub App signs commits made in the web editor.

Attributing commits to your account maintains an accurate history of who made changes to your documentation.
