## Publishing workflows

The editor supports two workflows for publishing documentation updates. The workflow you use depends on your repository's branch protection rules and the branch you work on.

If your repository has branch protection rules requiring review, the editor creates a pull request. Team members can review your changes before they go live. For collaboration workflows and team review processes, see [Collaborate](/editor/collaborate).

If there are no protection rules, your changes merge to the deployment branch and deploy immediately.

| Branch type | Branch protection | What happens when you publish |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| <Tooltip headline="Deployment branch" tip="The branch that publishes to your live documentation site, typically 'main'.">Deployment branch</Tooltip> | None | Commits and deploys changes |
| Deployment branch | Pull requests required | Creates a pull request |
| <Tooltip headline="Feature branch" tip="An isolated branch where you work on updates before merging to your deployment branch.">Feature branch</Tooltip> | None | Merges changes to deployment branch and deploys |
| Feature branch | Pull requests required | Creates a pull request |

<Tip>
  Configure branch protection rules in your Git provider to require pull requests. See [About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) in the GitHub docs or [Protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/branches/protected/) in the GitLab docs.

## Save changes

As you edit, the editor tracks your changes.

- New or deleted files.
- Content edits in pages.
- Navigation structure changes.
- Media uploads and organization.
- Configuration updates.

  <img src="/images/editor/toolbar-dark.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

When you work on your deployment branch, changes are saved automatically.

When you work on a feature branch, you can save changes to the branch as <Tooltip headline="Commit" tip="A commit is a saved snapshot of your changes in Git.">commits</Tooltip>.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/editor/toolbar-branch-light.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change and the Save as commit button on a feature branch." className="block dark:hidden" />
<img src="/images/editor/toolbar-branch-dark.png" alt="Web editor toolbar showing one pending change and the Save as commit button on a feature branch." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

To discard changes, click **Undo changes** beside a file name in the **Changes** dropdown.

### Publish your changes

If you are on your deployment branch, click **Publish** in the toolbar. Depending on your workflow, your changes are live as soon as your site redeploys or create a pull request and merge it in your Git provider.

If you are on a feature branch, save your changes and then click **Publish** in the toolbar. Depending on your workflow, your changes are live as soon as your site redeploys or create a pull request and merge it in your Git provider.

## Resolve conflicts

Conflicts occur when your branch and the deployment branch have incompatible changes to the same files.

### What causes conflicts

Conflicts happen when:

- You and another team member edit the same lines in a file.
- Files are moved or deleted in one branch but modified in another.

### Resolve conflicts

The editor displays warnings when conflicts prevent operations like publishing or switching branches. To resolve conflicts, follow the instructions in the editor to choose which changes to keep.

## Commit signing

Sign commits with your GitHub account by authorizing it in your [account settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account). Without authorization, the Mintlify GitHub App signs commits made in the web editor.

Attributing commits to your account maintains an accurate history of who made changes to your documentation.
