Suggestions let you propose changes to text without modifying the existing content. Teammates can review, accept, or reject your suggestions.

## Enable suggesting mode

1. Highlight any text on the page.
2. Click the **Switch to Suggesting** button, the pen icon, in the toolbar that appears.

A **Suggesting** indicator appears in the editor toolbar. All edits you make while suggesting mode is active are tracked as suggestions rather than applied directly.

To exit suggesting mode, click the **Suggesting** indicator.

## Make a suggestion

With suggesting mode enabled, edit any text. Any deletions or insertions appear with distinct highlighting so that reviewers can see what changes you propose.

## Accept a suggestion

1. Click highlighted suggestion text.
2. Click the accept button, the checkmark icon, to apply the suggested change.

Accepting a suggestion saves the updated text and resolves the suggestion thread.

## Reject a suggestion

1. Click highlighted suggestion text.
2. Click the reject button, the trashcan icon, to discard the proposed change.

Rejecting a suggestion preserves the original text and resolves the suggestion thread.
