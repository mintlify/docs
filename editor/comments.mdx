Comments let you and your team leave feedback on specific text in a page without editing the content. Use comments to ask questions, flag issues, or discuss changes before you publish them.

All [roles](/dashboard/roles)—-viewers, editors, and admins—-can leave and reply to comments. Only editors and admins can resolve comment threads.

If your branch has an open pull request on GitHub, Mintlify adds a summary of unresolved comment threads to the pull request description. The summary lists the files with open comments, the first comment in each thread, and a link to open that file in the editor with the comment sidebar open.

The summary updates automatically when you add, resolve, or delete a comment.
