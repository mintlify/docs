title: Overview
description: "The `navigation` property controls the hierarchy of your documentation."
---

It can contain one of seven properties:

- `pages`
- `groups`
- `anchors`
- `tabs`
- `dropdowns`
- `versions`
- `languages`

These properties all serve the function of partitioning your content and creating a hierarchy so that it's
easier for your users to navigate through your documentation.
