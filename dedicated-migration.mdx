description: 'How to migrate documentation from your existing provider'

There are two ways to migrate your documentation to Mintlify depending on a few factors:
- Your current documentation provider
- How technical your team is
- What Mintlify plan you have 

## Self-serve migration
<Tip>
We recommend this option if you're a technical team, currently use Readme or Docusaurus or Gitbook and are looking for a speedy migration process.
</Tip> 

You can use our [public packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping) to convert your existing documentation to Mintlify. We currently support migration for:
- [Readme](https://readme.com/)
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/)

Here's a quick guide on how to use the scraper:
<Steps>
<Step title="Commands">
You can install the scraper using the following commands:
- `mintlify-scrape section [url]` - Scrapes multiple pages in a site.
- `mintlify-scrape page [url]` - Scrapes a single page in a site.
</Step>
<Step title="Installation">
First, install the package:

```
npm i @mintlify/scraping
```

One-time use:
<CodeGroup>
```bash Section
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest section [url]
```

```bash Page
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest page [url]
```
</CodeGroup>

Global installation:

```
npm install @mintlify/scraping@latest -g
```

Global usage:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Section
mintlify-scrape section [url]
```

```bash Page
mintlify-scrape page [url]
```
</CodeGroup>
<Tip>
You can specify the output directory using the `-o` flag.
</Tip>
</Step>

## Dedicated migration
<Tip>
We recommend this option if you're a non-technical team, don't see your docs provider or have a home grown system and are one of our paid plans such as Pro, Growth or Enterprise..
</Tip>
