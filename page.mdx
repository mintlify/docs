## The Basics

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with the following metadata syntax
with `---` at the start and end:

<CodeGroup>

```md Schema
---
title: "title of the page"
---
```

```md Example
---
title: "Page"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>
  Mintlify will use the name of the file if you forget to include a title.
</Tip>

Other metadata goes in between the same `---` lines. For example, this page uses
this metadata:

```md
---
title: "Page Titles and Metadata"
description: "Setting the title and metadata for navigation and SEO"
---
```

## API Pages

API pages let you build interactive API playgrounds. To create an API page, you
must set an `api` or `openapi` property in the page metadata.

Learn more about API playgrounds in [our demo](/api-playground).

<CodeGroup>

```md Schema
api or openapi: method endpoint
```

```md API Example
api: "GET /users"
```

```md OpenAPI Example
openapi: "GET /users"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Descriptions

You can show a description that shows directly under the title with the
`description` metadata.

```md
description: "Your description goes here."
```

## Sidebar Title

You can show a different title in the navigation with the `sidebarTitle`
metadata. This is useful if your title is long and you want something shorter in
the navigation links.

```md
---
title: "Your very long page title you want to shorten"
sidebarTitle: "Short title"
---
```

## Sidebar Icons

Want an icon for your sidebar item like the ones in
[components](/content/components/accordions)? You can set an `icon` attribute in
the metadata! All icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) are
available for us. You can also set an icon type (optional). If not set, the icon
type will be regular.

```md
---
title: "Code Block"
icon: "rectangle-code"
iconType: "solid"
---
```

## Page Mode

The Page Mode setting allows you to customize the appearance of your page. You can choose from
different modes to adjust the layout according to your needs. If no mode is specified, the page
will use the default settings.

### No Mode

If no specific mode is given, the page will default to standard settings. This means the page
will display with the default table of contents (if headings are present) and other standard
elements, providing a typical layout without any special adjustments.

```md
---
title: "Page with no ToC"
---
```

### Wide Mode

In *Wide Mode*, you can hide the table of contents (ToC) on the right side of the page. This is
particularly useful if your page doesnâ€™t have any headings or if you prefer to utilize the
extra horizontal space for other content.

```md
---
title: "Page with no ToC"
mode: "wide"
---
```

### Custom Mode

*Custom Mode* provides a minimalist layout by removing all elements except for the top bar.
This mode offers a blank canvas, which is ideal for creating a "landing page" or any page where
you want a clean, distraction-free environment.


```md
---
mode: "custom"
---
```

## External Links

If you want the sidebar to open an external URL, you can set the `url` metadata
in any page.

```md
---
title: "Page that goes to external link"
url: "https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify"
---
```

## Search Engine Optimization

You can set meta tags like the image set when shared on social media by passing
them into your page's metadata. Meta tags with colons need to be wrapped in
quotes.

```md
"twitter:image": "/images/your-photo.jpg"
```

See [our SEO page](/settings/seo) for all supported meta tags.
