## Overview

Phishing Prevention is a core protection feature that combines database-driven categorization with advanced AI analysis to identify and block phishing attempts in real-time.

## How It Works

### Phishing Detection (Non AI)

<Info>
  We highly recommend you configure a Firewall rule to block "Phishing and Other Frauds" to block known-bad websites without relying on AI.
</Info>

Our "AI Phishing Scan" is meant to be supplemental to our existing Firewall functionality and threat intelligence. 

Our "Firewall" will block all known phishing websites, whereas "AI Phishing Scan" is designed to catch completely fresh phishing pages.

### Phishing Detection (AI Phishing Scan)

For Uncategorized or otherwise configured traffic, Repacket can inspect the webpage deeper to deliver a page-level decision.

Repacket may look at:
* The DOM of the page
* Images present on the page
* Visual render of the page
* URL and certificate characteristics

Based on our analysis of these properties - Repacket can determine a webpage *looks* like a legitimate login page, but is in fact completely fake.

### Handling Detection

When phishing is detected:
1. Users see a full-screen warning with an AI-generated explanation of the threat
2. Users can request exceptions if they believe the detection is a false positive
3. This block will be cached and shared for other users
4. Administrators can review and manage these exceptions

The analysis typically completes in about 2 seconds, and users aren't blocked until analysis is complete to avoid hindering productivity. Form submissions are halted during this process.

## Configuring Phishing Prevention

AI Phishing Scan can be configured through the [Protections](https://app.repacket.com/gateway#protections) rule builder:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Protections">
    Go to the [Protections](https://app.repacket.com/gateway#protections) section in your Repacket dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new rule">
    Click "Create new rule" and select "Phishing Prevention" as the rule type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define scope">
    Choose which categories to apply phishing protection to. By default, it runs on "Uncategorized" sites, but can be expanded to other categories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure response">
    Select whether to Block, Warn, or Allow when phishing is detected. We recommend using "Warn" for AI-detected phishing to account for potential false positives.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set exceptions">
    Optionally define exceptions for internal domains, trusted sites, or specific user groups.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your rule">
    Apply changes to enforce the phishing protection across your network.
  </Step>
</Steps>
