<Note>
  Bypass rules allow you to completely exclude traffic from Repacket's interception, ensuring certain websites or applications operate without any agent involvement.
</Note>

## Overview

Bypass rules enable you to exclude specific traffic from Repacket's interception entirely. Unlike Firewall Block rules, which still intercept and analyze traffic, Bypass rules tell the Repacket agent to completely ignore matching traffic and let it pass through without any processing.

## How It Works

Bypass rules operate at a lower level than Firewall rules. When traffic matches a bypass rule:

1. **No Interception**: The Repacket agent does not intercept the traffic at all
2. **No Analysis**: No categorization, scanning, or policy evaluation occurs
3. **Direct Connection**: Traffic flows directly to its destination without any Repacket involvement

This is fundamentally different from Firewall Block rules, which still intercept traffic to apply policies, perform categorization, and enable other security features.

### Bypass vs Firewall Block

| Feature | Bypass | Firewall Block |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Agent Interception | None | Yes |
| Traffic Analysis | None | Yes |
| Categorization | None | Yes |
| Policy Evaluation | None | Yes |

## Creating Bypass Rules

![](/images/bypass-rule.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Bypass Settings">
    Go to the [Gateway section](https://app.repacket.com/gateway#bypass) in your Repacket dashboard and select the "Bypass" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new bypass rule">
    Click the "+ Create bypass rule" button in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter a rule name">
    Provide a descriptive name for your bypass rule (e.g., "Bypass AWS", "Bypass Internal Tools").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define traffic conditions">
    In the Traffic rule section, set the scope of your policy by defining conditions that determine how rules match against traffic.
    
    Select an attribute from the dropdown:
    - **All Websites**: Bypass all web traffic
    - **Content Categories**: Bypass specific categories of websites
    - **IP Range**: Bypass traffic to specific IP address ranges
    - **Domain**: Bypass traffic to specific domains
    
    Then select a condition (e.g., "Equals", "Contains", "Matches") and specify the matching criteria.
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Define identity conditions">
    In the Identity section, define who the policy applies to by setting identity-based conditions.
    
    Click "+ Add property" to target:
    - Specific users
    - User groups
    - Devices
    
    If no identity conditions are specified, the bypass rule applies to all users and devices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your rule">
    Click "Save" to create the bypass rule. The rule will be enabled by default and immediately take effect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Bypass Rules

The Bypass page displays all your bypass rules in a table format with the following information:

- **Name**: The descriptive name you assigned to the rule
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp showing when the rule was last modified
- **Status**: A toggle switch indicating whether the rule is enabled (green) or disabled

### Rule Management Actions

- **Search**: Use the search bar to find rules by name
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle rules on or off using the status switch
- **Edit**: Click the ellipsis menu (⋮) to access additional options for each rule
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of rules if you have many configured

## Traffic Rule Attributes

Bypass rules support several traffic matching attributes:

### All Websites
Bypass all web traffic for the specified identity conditions. Use this sparingly, as it completely disables Repacket for matching users or devices.

### Content Categories
Bypass traffic to specific content categories (e.g., Business, Technology, Social Media). Useful for bypassing entire categories of websites that need direct access.

### IP Range
Bypass traffic to specific IP address ranges. Ideal for:
- Internal network resources
- Cloud service IP ranges (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- CDN endpoints
- Specific service providers

### Domain
Bypass traffic to specific domains or subdomains. Examples:
- `example.com` - bypasses all subdomains
- `*.example.com` - bypasses all subdomains using wildcard
- `api.example.com` - bypasses only the specific subdomain

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use for Performance-Critical Applications">
    Bypass rules are ideal for applications where even minimal latency from interception could impact performance, such as real-time trading platforms or high-frequency APIs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bypass Internal Resources">
    Configure bypass rules for internal network resources, intranet sites, and local services that don't require security scanning.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Specific Conditions">
    Prefer specific domain or IP range conditions over "All Websites" to maintain security coverage where possible. Only bypass what truly needs to be bypassed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Your Bypass Rules">
    Use descriptive rule names and consider documenting why each bypass rule exists. This helps with auditing and future maintenance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Bypass Rules Regularly">
    Periodically review your bypass rules to ensure they're still necessary. Remove bypass rules for services that no longer require exclusion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider Firewall Block Instead">
    If you need to permit traffic but still want visibility, categorization, and other security features, use a Firewall Block rule instead of a Bypass rule.
  </Accordion>
