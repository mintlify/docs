## Overview

The Data Loss Prevention (DLP) feature provides advanced controls to safeguard sensititive data online. Repacket recognizes sensitive data being uploaded to <Tooltip tip="Unapproved platforms are considered to be anything targeted by your Repacket rules.">unapproved platforms</Tooltip> and blocks it. 

Today, Repacket enables organizations to detect and take action on a wide variety of sensitive data types.

## How It Works

The DLP system operates by analyzing traffic based on the configured rules and applying specified actions when sensitive data is detected. Rules can be tailored to specific applications, users, and analysis types.

## Creating DLP Rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to DLP Settings">
    Go to the [Data Loss Prevention](https://app.repacket.com/dlp) section in your Repacket dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new rule">
    Click the "Create new rule" button in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your rule">
      Give your rule a descriptive name (e.g., "Block Healthcare Upload to ChatGPT").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select matching rules">
    Select what traffic properties or categories this should apply to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Select specific users">
    Select users that this rule should or shouldn't apply to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Analysis Type">
    We suggest applying "Text and Uploads" for all rules to target plaintext and file-based content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an action">
    Select Allow, Warn or Block based on your security policy.

    Warn actions can be configured to show a custom template, suggesting a company-approved alternative, for instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Your Rule">
    Apply your changes to enforce the new DLP rule across your network.
  </Step>
</Steps>
