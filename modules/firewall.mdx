## Overview

The Repacket Firewall allows administrators to control internet access by applying rules to different categories, domains, and user groups. This core feature provides precise control over what web resources can be accessed across your organization.

## How It Works

The Firewall operates by targeting internet traffic based on matching entities, and applying actions (allow, warn, block) as a result.

The "Identity" section of the rule builder can be used to target or make exceptions for different users and groups.



## Creating Firewall Rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Firewall Settings">
    Go to the [Firewall section](https://app.repacket.com/gateway#firewall) in your Repacket dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new rule">
    Click the "Create new rule" button in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select matching rules">
    Select what traffic properties or categories this should apply to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="(Optional) Select specific users">
    Select users that this rule should or shouldn't apply to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an action">
    Select Allow, Warn or Block based on your security policy.

    Warn actions can be configured to show a custom template, suggesting a company-approved alternative, for instance.
    
    <img src="/images/block-gambling.png" alt="Setting a Block rule for the Gambling category" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Apply your changes to enforce the new rule across your network.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with High-Risk Categories">
    Begin by blocking high-risk categories like Malware, Phishing, and Adult Content to establish baseline protection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Warn Mode for Borderline Categories">
    For categories that may have legitimate business uses (like Social Media), consider using Warn mode instead of Block.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create Role-Based Exceptions">
    Define exceptions based on job roles rather than individuals when possible for easier management.
