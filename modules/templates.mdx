<Note>
  Templates allow you to customize the appearance and messaging of firewall block and warning pages to match your organization's branding and communication style.
</Note>

## Overview

Templates enable you to customize the user-facing pages that appear when [Firewall](/modules/firewall) rules block or warn users about restricted content. You can personalize the title, description, and styling to align with your organization's brand and provide clear, consistent messaging to your users.

## Template Types

Repacket supports different template types for various firewall actions:

- **Firewall Block**: Displayed when a Block rule prevents access to a website or category
- **Firewall Warn**: Displayed when a Warn rule alerts users about potentially restricted content

Each template type can be customized independently, allowing you to have different messaging and styling for blocks versus warnings.

## Managing Templates

The Templates page displays all available templates in a table format, showing:

- **Template Type**: The type of template (e.g., Firewall Block, Firewall Warn)
- **Rule Type**: The category of rule this template applies to
- **Content**: A preview of the title and description text
- **Last Updated**: When the template was last modified
- **Preview**: Button to preview how the template appears to users
- **Edit**: Button to modify the template

## Creating and Editing Templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Templates">
    Go to the Templates section in your Repacket dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a template to edit">
    Click the "Edit" button next to the template type you want to customize (e.g., Firewall Block or Firewall Warn).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize the title">
    In the Title field, enter the heading that will appear at the top of the page (e.g., "Blocked" or "Warning").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize the description">
    In the Description field, enter the message that will be displayed to users. This message will automatically include the domain or category name that was blocked.
    
    For example: "has been blocked by your administrator. Please request an exception if you need to access this page."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the background">
    Choose between a solid color or gradient background:
    
    - **Solid**: Select a single color for the background
    - **Gradient**: Create a gradient effect with multiple colors and adjust the angle (e.g., 159°)
    
    Use the color picker to select your brand colors, or choose from the color swatches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview your changes">
    The left side of the editor shows a live preview of how your template will appear to users. Review the preview to ensure the styling and messaging look correct.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your template">
    Click "Save Template" to apply your changes. The template will immediately be used for all new firewall rules of that type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Template Configuration Options

### Title and Description

- **Title**: The main heading displayed on the blocked/warned page. Keep it concise and clear (e.g., "Blocked", "Warning", "Access Restricted").
- **Description**: The explanatory text that appears below the title. This text will automatically include the domain or category name that triggered the rule.

### Background Styling

**Solid Background:**
- Select a single color for a uniform background
- Useful for simple, clean designs that match your brand

**Gradient Background:**
- Create multi-color gradients for a more dynamic appearance
- Adjust the gradient angle to control the direction of the color transition
- Add or remove color stops to create complex gradient effects
- Use the color spectrum slider to fine-tune color selection

### Color Selection

The template editor provides multiple ways to select colors:
- **Color Picker**: Click anywhere in the color picker to select a color
- **Color Swatches**: Quick access to recently used or preset colors
- **Color Spectrum Slider**: Fine-tune your color selection across the full spectrum

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Messages Clear and Actionable">
    Write descriptions that clearly explain why access was blocked and what actions users can take (e.g., request an exception, contact IT support).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match Your Brand Guidelines">
    Use your organization's brand colors and maintain consistency with your other communications. This helps users recognize legitimate security messages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Different Background Styles">
    Consider using gradients for a modern look, or solid colors for better readability. Ensure text remains legible against your chosen background.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Differentiate Block vs Warn">
    Use distinct styling or messaging for Block templates versus Warn templates so users can quickly understand the severity of the restriction.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include Action Buttons">
    Ensure your template descriptions guide users to available actions, such as "Request Access" buttons that appear on the blocked page.
