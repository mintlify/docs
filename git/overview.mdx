description: Essential Git commands for version control and collaboration
---

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your project history.

## Getting started

If you're new to Git, start with these essential commands:

- [git init](/git/init) - Initialize a new Git repository
- [git clone](/git/clone) - Copy an existing repository
- [git config](/git/config) - Configure your Git settings

## Basic workflow

These commands form the core Git workflow:

- [git status](/git/status) - Check repository status
- [git add](/git/add) - Stage changes for commit
- [git commit](/git/commit) - Save changes to repository
- [git log](/git/log) - View commit history

## Working with branches

Branches let you work on features independently:

- [git branch](/git/branch) - List, create, or delete branches
- [git checkout](/git/checkout) - Switch between branches
- [git merge](/git/merge) - Combine branches
- [git rebase](/git/rebase) - Reapply commits on top of another branch

## Syncing with remotes

Share your work with remote repositories:

- [git remote](/git/remote) - Manage remote repositories
- [git fetch](/git/fetch) - Download objects from remote
- [git pull](/git/pull) - Fetch and merge changes
- [git push](/git/push) - Upload local changes

## Inspecting changes

Review and compare your work:

- [git diff](/git/diff) - Show changes between commits
- [git show](/git/show) - Display commit details
- [git blame](/git/blame) - Show who modified each line

## Undoing changes

Fix mistakes and revert changes:

- [git reset](/git/reset) - Undo commits or unstage files
- [git revert](/git/revert) - Create new commit that undoes changes
- [git restore](/git/restore) - Discard changes in working directory
- [git stash](/git/stash) - Temporarily save changes

## Advanced operations

For more complex workflows:

- [git tag](/git/tag) - Mark specific points in history
- [git cherry-pick](/git/cherry-pick) - Apply specific commits
- [git reflog](/git/reflog) - View reference logs
