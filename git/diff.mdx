title: git diff
description: Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
---

Display differences between various Git objects.

## Syntax

```bash
git diff [options] [<commit>] [<commit>] [--] [<path>]
```

## Description

`git diff` shows what has changed in your repository. You can compare working directory changes, staged changes, commits, branches, and more.

## Common usage

Show unstaged changes:

```bash
git diff
```

Show staged changes:

```bash
git diff --staged
```

Compare two commits:

```bash
git diff commit1 commit2
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--staged, --cached" type="flag">
  Show changes staged for commit
  
  ```bash
  git diff --staged
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--name-only" type="flag">
  Show only names of changed files
  
  ```bash
  git diff --name-only
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--name-status" type="flag">
  Show names and change types (Added, Modified, Deleted)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--stat" type="flag">
  Show summary statistics
  
  ```bash
  git diff --stat
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--color-words" type="flag">
  Show word-level differences
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Unstaged changes

```bash
git diff
```

Shows changes in working directory not yet staged.

### Staged changes

```bash
git diff --staged
```

Shows changes that will be included in the next commit.

### Compare branches

```bash
git diff main feature-branch
```

### Compare commits

```bash
git diff abc123 def456
```

### Specific file

```bash
git diff path/to/file.txt
```

### Changes since last commit

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

### Changes between branches

```bash
git diff main..feature-branch
```

## Understanding diff output

```diff
diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
index 1234567..abcdefg 100644
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 This line stays
-This line was removed
+This line was added
+Another new line
 This line stays too
```

- `---` lines removed
- `+++` lines added
- `@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@` shows line numbers
- Context lines (unchanged) also shown

## Common workflows

### Review before committing

```bash
# Check unstaged changes
git diff

# Stage some files
git add file1.txt

# Check what's staged
git diff --staged

# Commit
git commit
```

### Compare with remote

```bash
git diff origin/main
```

### See what changed in last commit

```bash
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
```

### Compare specific files between branches

```bash
git diff main feature-branch -- path/to/file.txt
```

## Filtering output

### Show only file names

```bash
git diff --name-only
```

### Show statistics

```bash
git diff --stat
```

Output:
```
file1.txt | 10 +++++-----
file2.txt | 5 +++++
2 files changed, 10 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)
```

### Show only specific file types

```bash
git diff -- '*.js'
```

## Word-level diff

See changes at word level instead of line level:

```bash
git diff --color-words
```

Useful for prose and documentation.

## Viewing diffs

### In external tool

```bash
git difftool
```

Configure your preferred tool:

```bash
git config --global diff.tool vscode
```

### Pager navigation

- `Space` - Scroll down
- `b` - Scroll up
- `q` - Quit
- `/pattern` - Search
- `n` - Next match

## Advanced usage

### Ignore whitespace

```bash
git diff -w
```

### Show function names

```bash
git diff -p
```

### Compare working directory to remote

```bash
git diff HEAD origin/main
```

### Unified diff with more context

```bash
git diff -U10
```

Shows 10 lines of context instead of default 3.

## Diff between commits

### Last commit vs working directory

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

### Two commits ago vs now

```bash
git diff HEAD~2
```

### Specific commits

```bash
git diff abc123..def456
```

## Common scenarios

### What did I change?

```bash
git diff
```

### What am I about to commit?

```bash
git diff --staged
```

### What's different from main branch?

```bash
git diff main
```

### What changed in the last commit?

```bash
git diff HEAD~1
```

## Best practices

- Review `git diff` before `git add`
- Review `git diff --staged` before `git commit`
- Use `--stat` for quick overview
- Use `--name-only` when you just need file list
- Configure a visual diff tool for complex changes
