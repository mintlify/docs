title: git branch
description: List, create, or delete branches
---

Manage branches in your repository.

## Syntax

```bash
git branch [options] [<branch-name>]
```

## Description

`git branch` lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, and experiment safely without affecting the main codebase.

## Common usage

List all local branches:

```bash
git branch
```

Create a new branch:

```bash
git branch feature-name
```

Delete a branch:

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

## Options

<ParamField path="-a, --all" type="flag">
  List both local and remote branches
  
  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-d, --delete" type="flag">
  Delete a fully merged branch
  
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature-branch
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-D" type="flag">
  Force delete a branch regardless of merge status
  
  ```bash
  git branch -D unmerged-branch
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-m, --move" type="flag">
  Rename a branch
  
  ```bash
  git branch -m old-name new-name
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-r, --remotes" type="flag">
  List remote-tracking branches
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-v, --verbose" type="flag">
  Show branch details including last commit
</ParamField>

## Examples

### List branches

```bash
# Local branches only
git branch

# All branches
git branch -a

# Remote branches only
git branch -r

# With commit details
git branch -v
```

### Create a branch

```bash
git branch new-feature
```

This creates the branch but doesn't switch to it. To switch:

```bash
git checkout new-feature
```

Or create and switch in one command:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

### Rename a branch

```bash
# Rename current branch
git branch -m new-name

# Rename different branch
git branch -m old-name new-name
```

### Delete a branch

```bash
# Delete if fully merged
git branch -d feature-branch

# Force delete even if not merged
git branch -D experimental-branch
```

### Delete a remote branch

```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

## Branch naming conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:

**Good names:**
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/login-error`
- `docs/api-guide`
- `refactor/database-layer`

**Poor names:**
- `temp`
- `test`
- `my-branch`
- `fix`

## Common workflows

### Feature branch workflow

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# After merging, delete local branch
git checkout main
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

### List branches with details

```bash
git branch -vv
```

Shows local branches with their tracking remote branches and last commit.

### Clean up merged branches

```bash
# List merged branches
git branch --merged

# Delete merged branches
git branch -d old-feature another-old-feature
```

## Tracking branches

### Set upstream tracking

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
```

### View tracking relationships

```bash
git branch -vv
```

## Best practices

- Use descriptive branch names
- Delete branches after merging
- Keep branch names short but meaningful
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`)
- Regularly clean up stale branches
- Don't work directly on `main` or `master`
