title: git merge
description: Join two or more development histories together
---

Combine changes from different branches.

## Syntax

```bash
git merge [options] <branch>
```

## Description

`git merge` integrates changes from one branch into another. It creates a new commit that combines the histories of both branches.

## Common usage

Merge a feature branch into current branch:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--no-ff" type="flag">
  Create a merge commit even if fast-forward is possible
  
  ```bash
  git merge --no-ff feature-branch
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--ff-only" type="flag">
  Only merge if fast-forward is possible
  
  ```bash
  git merge --ff-only feature-branch
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--squash" type="flag">
  Combine all commits into one before merging
  
  ```bash
  git merge --squash feature-branch
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--abort" type="flag">
  Abort current merge and restore pre-merge state
  
  ```bash
  git merge --abort
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-m" type="string">
  Specify custom merge commit message
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Basic merge

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

### Merge with no fast-forward

Preserve branch history:

```bash
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

### Squash merge

Combine all feature commits into one:

```bash
git merge --squash feature-branch
git commit -m "Add complete feature"
```

### Merge specific commit

```bash
git merge abc123
```

## Merge strategies

### Fast-forward merge

When the target branch hasn't diverged:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
# Results in fast-forward
```

The branch pointer simply moves forward. No merge commit is created.

### Three-way merge

When both branches have new commits:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
# Creates merge commit
```

Git creates a new commit with two parents, combining both histories.

## Handling merge conflicts

When conflicts occur:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
```

### Resolve conflicts

1. Open conflicted files and look for conflict markers:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

2. Edit to resolve conflicts
3. Stage resolved files:

```bash
git add resolved-file.txt
```

4. Complete the merge:

```bash
git commit
```

### Abort merge

If you want to cancel:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

## Common workflows

### Feature branch merge

```bash
# Update main
git checkout main
git pull

# Merge feature
git merge feature-branch

# Push
git push
```

### Merge main into feature branch

Keep feature branch up to date:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
```

### Safe merge with check

```bash
# Check what would be merged
git diff main..feature-branch

# Merge
git merge feature-branch
```

## Merge vs Rebase

### Use merge when:
- You want to preserve complete history
- Working on shared/public branches
- Branch history is important

### Use rebase when:
- You want a linear history
- Working on personal feature branches
- Commits are not yet pushed

## Best practices

- Always pull latest changes before merging
- Review diffs before merging
- Use `--no-ff` for feature branches to preserve history
- Write descriptive merge commit messages
- Test after merging before pushing
- Delete feature branch after successful merge

## Undo a merge

### Before pushing

```bash
# Undo merge, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo merge, discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### After pushing

```bash
# Create revert commit
git revert -m 1 HEAD
```

## Advanced merging

### Merge with custom strategy

```bash
git merge -X theirs feature-branch  # Favor their changes
git merge -X ours feature-branch     # Favor our changes
```

### Merge without committing

```bash
git merge --no-commit feature-branch
# Review changes
git commit
```
