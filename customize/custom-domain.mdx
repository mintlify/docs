To host your documentation on a custom domain:
1. Add your domain in your dashboard.
2. Configure DNS settings on your domain provider.
3. Allow time for DNS to propagate and TLS certificates to be automatically provisioned.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a subpath like `example.com/docs`? See [/docs subpath](/deploy/docs-subpath).
</Info>

## Add your custom domain

1. Navigate to the [Custom domain setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) page in your dashboard.
2. Enter your domain name. For example, `docs.example.com` or `www.example.com`.
3. Click **Add domain**.

</Frame>

## Configure your DNS

1. On your domain provider's website, navigate to your domain's DNS settings.
2. Create a new DNS record with the following values:

```text
CNAME | docs | cname.mintlify-dns.com.
```

<Tip>
  Each domain provider has different ways to add DNS records. Refer to your domain provider's documentation for specific instructions.
</Tip>

### DNS propagation

DNS changes typically take 1-24 hours to propagate globally, though it can take up to 48 hours in some cases. You can verify your DNS is configured correctly using [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org).

Once your DNS records are active, your documentation is first accessible via HTTP. HTTPS is available after Vercel provisions your TLS certificate.

### Automatic TLS provisioning

Once your DNS records propagate and resolve correctly, Vercel automatically provisions a free SSL/TLS certificate for your domain using Let's Encrypt.

This typically completes within a few hours of DNS propagation, though it can take up to 24 hours in rare cases. Certificates are automatically renewed before expiration.

### CAA records

If your domain uses CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) records, you must authorize Let's Encrypt to issue certificates for your domain. Add the following CAA record to your DNS settings:

```text
0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
```

### Reserved paths

The `/.well-known/acme-challenge` path is reserved for certificate validation and cannot be redirected or rewritten. If you have configured redirects or rewrites for this path, certificate provisioning will fail.

## DNS provider setup guides

Follow the step-by-step guide for your DNS provider to configure your custom domain.

## Subdomain vs root domain

Understanding the difference between subdomain and root domain setup helps you choose the right configuration for your documentation.

### Subdomain (recommended)

A subdomain is a prefix added to your main domain, such as `docs.example.com` or `help.example.com`.

**Advantages:**
- Easier DNS configuration using CNAME records
- Better organization and separation of services
- More flexible for future changes
- Standard practice for documentation sites

**Setup:**
Use a CNAME record pointing to `cname.mintlify-dns.com`.

### Root domain (apex domain)

A root domain is your main domain without any prefix, such as `example.com`.

**Limitations:**
- CNAME records cannot be used at the root level (DNS specification)
- Requires A records pointing to specific IP addresses
- Less flexible if infrastructure changes
- May conflict with email services (MX records)

**Alternative:**
If you must use a root domain, contact your DNS provider about ALIAS or ANAME records, which function like CNAME records but work at the root level. Not all providers support these record types.

<Tip>
  We strongly recommend using a subdomain like `docs.example.com` for your documentation. This provides the most reliable and flexible setup.
</Tip>

## Migrating from .mintlify.app to custom domain

Follow these steps to migrate your documentation from your `.mintlify.app` subdomain to a custom domain without downtime.

### Step 1: Add your custom domain

1. Navigate to the [Custom domain setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) page.
2. Enter your custom domain (e.g., `docs.example.com`).
3. Click **Add domain**.
4. Keep your `.mintlify.app` domain active during migration.

### Step 2: Configure DNS

Follow the [DNS provider setup guide](#dns-provider-setup-guides) for your provider to add the required CNAME record.

### Step 3: Wait for DNS propagation

1. DNS changes typically take 1-24 hours to propagate.
2. Verify DNS propagation using [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org).
3. Your documentation remains accessible via `.mintlify.app` during this time.

### Step 4: Wait for SSL certificate

1. After DNS propagates, Vercel automatically provisions an SSL/TLS certificate.
2. This typically takes a few hours but can take up to 24 hours.
3. Your custom domain becomes accessible via HTTPS once the certificate is issued.

### Step 5: Set canonical URL

Update your `docs.json` to set your custom domain as the canonical URL:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://docs.example.com"
    }
}
```

This tells search engines that your custom domain is the primary URL.

### Step 6: Update external links

Update links to your documentation in:
- Your main website
- README files
- Email signatures
- Social media profiles
- Third-party integrations

### Step 7: Set up redirects (optional)

Your `.mintlify.app` domain continues to work and automatically redirects to your custom domain. You can keep both active or remove the `.mintlify.app` domain from your dashboard if you prefer.

<Tip>
  There is no downtime during migration. Your documentation remains accessible via `.mintlify.app` until your custom domain is fully configured.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### DNS propagation issues

**Problem:** DNS changes are not taking effect.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check DNS configuration:**
   - Verify the CNAME record points to `cname.mintlify-dns.com`
   - Ensure there are no typos in the subdomain or target
   - Confirm there are no conflicting A or CNAME records

2. **Verify DNS propagation:**
   - Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to check global propagation
   - Enter your full domain (e.g., `docs.example.com`)
   - Look for CNAME records pointing to `cname.mintlify-dns.com`

3. **Clear DNS cache:**
   - Flush your local DNS cache:
     - **Windows:** `ipconfig /flushdns`
     - **macOS:** `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
     - **Linux:** `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`
   - Try accessing your domain in an incognito/private browser window

4. **Wait longer:**
   - DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours in rare cases
   - Check back periodically rather than repeatedly refreshing

5. **Check TTL settings:**
   - If you recently changed DNS records, the old TTL value determines how long old records are cached
   - Wait for the previous TTL duration to expire

### SSL/TLS certificate issues

**Problem:** Your custom domain shows a certificate error or is not accessible via HTTPS.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify DNS is propagated:**
   - SSL certificates cannot be issued until DNS is fully propagated
   - Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to confirm DNS is resolving correctly worldwide

2. **Check CAA records:**
   - If you have CAA records, ensure Let's Encrypt is authorized
   - Add a CAA record: `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"`
   - Remove any CAA records that restrict certificate issuance

3. **Verify Cloudflare settings (if applicable):**
   - Ensure SSL/TLS encryption mode is set to **Full (strict)**
   - Disable **Always Use HTTPS** in Edge Certificates settings
   - Confirm proxy status is set to **DNS only** (gray cloud)

4. **Check for redirects:**
   - Ensure the `/.well-known/acme-challenge` path is not redirected or rewritten
   - This path is required for Let's Encrypt validation

5. **Wait for automatic provisioning:**
   - Certificate provisioning can take up to 24 hours after DNS propagates
   - Vercel automatically retries if initial attempts fail

6. **Contact support:**
   - If certificate issues persist after 24 hours, contact Mintlify support
   - Provide your domain name and any error messages

### Domain not resolving

**Problem:** Your custom domain shows a "domain not found" or similar error.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify domain is added in dashboard:**
   - Check the [Custom domain setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) page
   - Ensure your domain is listed and shows as active

2. **Check CNAME record:**
   - Verify the CNAME record exists in your DNS settings
   - Confirm it points to `cname.mintlify-dns.com` (note the trailing dot may be added automatically)
   - Ensure the subdomain matches what you entered in the dashboard

3. **Remove conflicting records:**
   - Delete any A records for the same subdomain
   - You cannot have both A and CNAME records for the same name

4. **Verify nameservers:**
   - Ensure your domain is using the correct nameservers
   - If you recently transferred your domain, nameserver changes can take 24-48 hours

5. **Check domain status:**
   - Ensure your domain registration is active and not expired
   - Verify your domain is not locked or suspended

### Cloudflare-specific issues

**Problem:** Domain not working with Cloudflare as DNS provider.

**Solutions:**
1. **Disable proxy (orange cloud):**
   - The CNAME record must have proxy status set to **DNS only** (gray cloud)
   - Click the orange cloud icon to toggle it to gray

2. **Set correct SSL/TLS mode:**
   - Navigate to **SSL/TLS** > **Overview**
   - Set encryption mode to **Full (strict)**

3. **Disable Always Use HTTPS:**
   - Navigate to **SSL/TLS** > **Edge Certificates**
   - Scroll to **Always Use HTTPS** and toggle it off
   - This prevents interference with Let's Encrypt validation

4. **Check Page Rules:**
   - Navigate to **Rules** > **Page Rules**
   - Ensure no rules are redirecting or modifying your documentation subdomain
   - Disable any rules that might interfere with certificate validation

5. **Verify DNSSEC:**
   - If DNSSEC is enabled, ensure it's properly configured
   - Misconfigured DNSSEC can prevent DNS resolution

### Mixed content warnings

**Problem:** Browser shows mixed content warnings or some resources fail to load.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for SSL certificate:**
   - Ensure your SSL/TLS certificate is fully provisioned
   - Access your site via `https://` explicitly

2. **Check canonical URL:**
   - Verify your canonical URL in `docs.json` uses `https://`
   - Update any `http://` references to `https://`

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Clear your browser cache and cookies
   - Try accessing in an incognito/private window

### Vercel verification issues

**Problem:** Vercel requires verification but the TXT record is not being recognized.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify TXT record format:**
   - Ensure you copied the exact verification value from Mintlify
   - Check for extra spaces or characters

2. **Wait for DNS propagation:**
   - TXT records also require time to propagate
   - Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify TXT record propagation

3. **Check record name:**
   - Ensure the TXT record name matches what Mintlify provided
   - Some providers require `@` for root domain, others require the full domain

4. **Contact support:**
   - If verification fails after 24 hours, contact Mintlify support with your domain name

## Set a canonical URL

After configuring your DNS, set a canonical URL to ensure search engines index your preferred domain. A canonical URL tells search engines which version of your documentation is the primary one. This improves SEO when your documentation is accessible from multiple URLs and prevents issues with duplicate content.

Add the `canonical` meta tag to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://www.your-custom-domain-here.com"
    }
}
```

Replace `https://www.your-custom-domain-here.com` with your actual custom domain. For example, if your custom domain is `docs.mintlify.com`, you would use:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://docs.mintlify.com"
    }
}
```
