To set up your documentation on a custom domain, you'll need to set your desired custom domain in your Mintlify settings and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a custom subdirectory like `mintlify.com/docs`? See the [custom subdirectory](/deploy/cloudflare) docs.

## Dashboard settings

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Select **Settings**
3. Select **Domain Setup**
4. Enter your desired custom domain. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-light.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Configuring your DNS

1. Proceed to your domain's DNS settings on your domain provider's website.
2. Create a new DNS entry, inputting the following values:

```bash
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com.
```

<Frame>
  <img alt="DNS" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/mintlify-dns.png" />
</Frame>

## Provider-specific settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vercel verification">
    If Vercel is your domain provider, you must add a verification `TXT` record. This information will show on your dashboard after submitting your custom domain, as well as be emailed to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cloudflare security settings">
    If Cloudflare is your DNS provider, you must enable the "full strict" security option for the https setting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Set a canonical URL

After setting up your custom domain, you should set a canonical URL to ensure search engines index your preferred domain. A canonical URL tells search engines which version of your documentation is the primary one. This improves SEO when your documentation is accessible from multiple URLs and prevents issues with duplicate content.

Add the `canonical` meta tag to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://www.your-custom-domain-here.com"
    }
}
```

Replace `https://www.your-custom-domain-here.com` with your actual custom domain. For example, if your custom domain is `docs.mintlify.com`, you would use:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://docs.mintlify.com"
    }
}
```
