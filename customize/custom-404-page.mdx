title: "Custom 404 page"
description: "Customize the title and description of your 404 error page"
---

You can control the title and description of the 404 error page that appears when users navigate to broken or missing links.

When customizing your 404 page, use the description to guide users to helpful resources or links in your documentation that can help them find what they're looking for.

## Configuration

Configure your 404 page in the `errors.404` section of your `docs.json` file:

```json
"errors": {
  "404": {
    "redirect": false,
    "title": "I can't be found",
    "description": "What ever **happened** to this _page_?"
  }
}
```

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="redirect" type="boolean">
  Whether to automatically redirect to the home page when a page is not found.
  
  Set to `true` to redirect to the home page.

  Set to `false` to show the custom 404 page.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="title" type="string">
  Custom title for the 404 error page. This replaces the default "Page not found" heading.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  Custom description for the 404 error page. Supports Markdown formatting.
</ResponseField>

## AI-powered recommendations

Mintlify automatically suggests up to three relevant pages when someone lands on your 404 screen. The recommendations are generated by the same search index that powers site search, so readers can quickly jump to similar content without starting a new query.

- Keep the default 404 layout (or extend it with custom content) to display the recommended links beneath your title and description.
- Ensure your site is connected to Mintlify search so the AI has an up-to-date index of your documentation. If search is not yet enabled for your workspace, contact [support@mintlify.com](mailto:support@mintlify.com) to turn it on.

If you need to disable the AI suggestions for compliance or branding reasons, reach out to support and we can turn the feature off for your project.
