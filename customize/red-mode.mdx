Red mode applies a red color filter to your documentation, reducing blue light emission. This is useful for:

- Reading documentation in dark environments without disrupting night vision
- Reducing eye strain during extended late-night coding sessions
- Users who prefer warmer color temperatures

## Enable red mode

Add the `redMode` option to your `docs.json` configuration:

```json docs.json
{
  "appearance": {
    "redMode": true
  }
}
```

## Configuration options

<ResponseField name="redMode" type="boolean | object">
  Enable red mode for your documentation. Set to `true` for default settings, or pass an object for advanced configuration.

  <Expandable title="Advanced options">
    <ResponseField name="intensity" type="number" default="0.5">
      The intensity of the red filter, from `0` (subtle) to `1` (full red).
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="toggle" type="boolean" default="true">
      Show a toggle button in the navigation bar for users to switch red mode on/off.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Example with advanced options

```json docs.json
{
  "appearance": {
    "redMode": {
      "intensity": 0.7,
      "toggle": true
    }
  }
}
```

## User toggle

When `toggle` is enabled, users can switch red mode on or off using the moon icon in the top navigation bar. Their preference is saved in local storage.
