## Understanding color configuration

The `colors` object in `docs.json` controls the color scheme of your documentation. Each theme applies these colors differently, so understanding how they work is essential for achieving the look you want.

### Color properties explained

You configure colors in `docs.json` using three properties:

```json docs.json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#3B82F6",
    "light": "#60A5FA",
    "dark": "#1E40AF"
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="primary" type="string" required>
  The main accent color for your documentation. Used for emphasis in light mode, including links, buttons, and interactive elements. The specific usage varies by theme.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="light" type="string">
  The accent color for dark mode. When users switch to dark mode, this color replaces `primary` for emphasis elements. If not specified, `primary` is used in both modes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="dark" type="string">
  The color for buttons, hover states, and secondary interactive elements across both light and dark modes. Some themes use this for additional emphasis or contrast.
</ResponseField>

### How themes use colors

Different themes apply color properties in different ways:

**Mint, Maple, and Palm** use `primary` for links and emphasis in light mode, `light` for links and emphasis in dark mode, and `dark` for button backgrounds and hover states.

**Willow and Linden** apply `primary` more prominently to navigation elements and headings, with `dark` used for interactive states.

**Almond and Aspen** use `primary` for card borders and accents, `light` for dark mode variants, and `dark` for button fills.

**Sequoia** applies colors minimally, using `primary` sparingly for key interactive elements only.

### Common color patterns

Here are proven color combinations for different use cases:

<CodeGroup>

```json Blue theme
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#3B82F6",
    "light": "#60A5FA",
    "dark": "#1E40AF"
  }
}
```

```json Green theme
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#10B981",
    "light": "#34D399",
    "dark": "#059669"
  }
}
```

```json Purple theme
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#8B5CF6",
    "light": "#A78BFA",
    "dark": "#6D28D9"
  }
}
```

```json Monochrome theme
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#374151",
    "light": "#9CA3AF",
    "dark": "#1F2937"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Testing color combinations

To ensure your colors work well across both light and dark modes:

1. **Check contrast ratios** - Use a tool like [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify your colors meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

2. **Test in both modes** - Toggle between light and dark mode in your documentation to see how colors appear. The mode toggle is in the top navigation bar.

3. **Preview on different screens** - Colors appear differently on various displays. Test on multiple devices if possible.

4. **Use the CLI preview** - Run `mint dev` locally to see changes in real-time before deploying.

### Troubleshooting contrast issues

If you encounter white-on-white text or other contrast problems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="White button text on white background">
    This typically happens when `primary` is too light. Button text color is automatically determined based on the background color.

    **Solution:** Use a darker shade for your `primary` color, or specify a darker `dark` color for button backgrounds:

    ```json
    {
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#3B82F6",
        "dark": "#1E40AF"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Links are hard to read in dark mode">
    If you only specify `primary` without `light`, the same color is used in dark mode, which may not have enough contrast.

    **Solution:** Add a `light` color that's brighter and works well on dark backgrounds:

    ```json
    {
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#2563EB",
        "light": "#60A5FA"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hover states are invisible">
    This occurs when `dark` is too similar to your background color or when it's not specified.

    **Solution:** Ensure `dark` has sufficient contrast with both light and dark backgrounds:

    ```json
    {
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#3B82F6",
        "light": "#60A5FA",
        "dark": "#1E40AF"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Colors look different than expected">
    Each theme interprets color properties differently based on its design system.

    **Solution:** Preview your documentation with different themes to see how colors are applied. You may need to adjust values for your chosen theme:

    ```bash
    mint dev
    ```

    Then change the `theme` value in `docs.json` and refresh to compare.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Theme-specific color behavior

Each theme has unique characteristics that affect how colors appear:

**Mint** - Traditional documentation theme with high color saturation. Colors are prominent and used frequently throughout the interface.

**Maple** - Modern, clean aesthetic with subtle color usage. Colors appear primarily on interactive elements and accents.

**Palm** - Enterprise-focused with sophisticated color application. Uses colors for hierarchy and emphasis in complex layouts.

**Willow** - Minimalist theme with restrained color usage. Colors are used sparingly for maximum impact.

**Linden** - Retro terminal theme with monospace fonts. Colors are applied to mimic classic terminal interfaces.

**Almond** - Card-based design with colors used for borders and subtle accents. Color application is gentle and non-intrusive.

**Aspen** - Modern theme with bold color usage in navigation and components. Colors are used to create visual hierarchy.

**Sequoia** - Content-first theme with minimal color application. Colors appear only on essential interactive elements.

### Advanced color customization

For more control over specific elements, you can use custom CSS:

```css custom.css
:root {
  --primary: #3B82F6;
  --primary-light: #60A5FA;
  --primary-dark: #1E40AF;
}

/* Override specific elements */
.docs-button {
  background-color: var(--primary-dark);
}

.docs-link:hover {
  color: var(--primary);
}
```

Then reference your custom CSS file in `docs.json`:

```json docs.json
{
  "styling": {
    "css": "/custom.css"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Custom CSS is an advanced feature. Changes may affect your documentation's appearance in unexpected ways. Always test thoroughly before deploying.
