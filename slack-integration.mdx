- **Build succeeded**: Confirmation when builds complete successfully  
- **Build failed**: Alerts when builds encounter errors with details

Stay informed about your documentation deployments:

- **Deployment completed**: Confirmation of successful deployments
- **Deployment failed**: Alerts for failed deployments with error details

### Content updates
Track changes to your documentation content:

- **New pages added**: Notifications when team members add new documentation pages
- **Pages updated**: Alerts when existing pages are modified
- **Pages deleted**: Notifications when pages are removed

## Using Slack commands

Once installed, you can use these Slack commands to interact with your documentation:

### `/mintlify status`
Check the current status of your documentation builds and deployments.

```

Trigger a manual deployment of your documentation (requires appropriate permissions).

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slack app not appearing in workspace">
    **Solution**: Ensure you have admin permissions in your Slack workspace. If you're not an admin, ask a workspace admin to install the app or grant you the necessary permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not receiving notifications">
    **Solution**: 
    1. Check that the Mintlify app has permission to post in your selected channels
    2. Verify your notification settings in the Mintlify dashboard
    3. Ensure the channels you selected still exist and the app is a member
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Commands not working">
    **Solution**: 
    1. Make sure you're using the correct command syntax
    2. Verify you have the necessary permissions to use the command
    3. Try reinstalling the app if commands consistently fail
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Duplicate notifications">
    **Solution**: Check if you have multiple notification rules set up for the same events. Remove duplicate configurations in your dashboard settings.
