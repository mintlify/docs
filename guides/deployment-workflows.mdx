Effective deployment workflows ensure your documentation stays synchronized with your codebase, maintains quality through automated checks, and provides safe rollback mechanisms when issues arise.

## Deployment lifecycle

Understanding the complete deployment lifecycle helps you optimize your documentation workflow and troubleshoot issues effectively.

### Development phase

1. **Local development**: Use `mint dev` to preview changes locally before committing
2. **Branch creation**: Create feature branches for significant changes or updates
3. **Content validation**: Run local checks to catch errors early

### Review phase

1. **Pull request creation**: Open a PR against your deployment branch
2. **Preview deployment**: Automatically generated preview URLs for review
3. **CI checks**: Automated linting, broken link detection, and style validation
4. **Team review**: Collaborate with stakeholders using preview deployments

### Production phase

1. **Merge to deployment branch**: Triggers automatic production deployment
2. **Build process**: Mintlify builds and optimizes your documentation
3. **Deployment**: Changes go live on your production domain
4. **Verification**: Monitor deployment status and validate changes

## Setting up CI/CD pipelines

Automate quality checks and deployment processes to maintain documentation standards.

### GitHub integration

Connect your repository to enable automated deployments and CI checks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
    Navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) and install the Mintlify GitHub App. Grant access only to your documentation repository for security.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure deployment branch">
    Set your deployment branch in [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings). This branch triggers production deployments when updated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable CI checks">
    Go to [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) and enable CI checks. Choose between `Warning` (non-blocking) or `Blocking` (prevents merge on failure) levels.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Available CI checks

Configure automated checks to maintain documentation quality:

**Broken links**: Automatically detects internal broken links before deployment. Similar to running `mint dev` locally, this check scans all documentation content.

**Vale linting**: Enforces style and tone consistency using Vale, an open-source prose linter. Configure with a `.vale.ini` file in your repository root, or use the default Mintlify configuration.

```ini Example .vale.ini
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
Vocab = YourCompany

[*.mdx]
BasedOnStyles = Vale
```

### GitLab integration

For GitLab repositories, configure webhooks to trigger deployments:

1. Navigate to your GitLab repository settings
2. Add a webhook pointing to your Mintlify deployment endpoint
3. Configure to trigger on push events to your deployment branch

## Managing multiple environments

Separate staging and production environments enable safe testing before releasing changes to users.

### Staging environment with preview deployments

Preview deployments serve as staging environments for documentation changes.

**Automatic previews**: Created automatically for pull requests targeting your deployment branch. Each preview updates with new commits.

**Manual previews**: Create previews for any branch from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Previews">
    Go to the Previews section in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create custom preview">
    Select **Create custom preview** and enter the branch name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share preview URL">
    Share the generated URL with stakeholders for review.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Production environment

Your production environment deploys from your configured deployment branch (typically `main` or `master`).

**Custom domains**: Configure custom domains in your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) to serve documentation from your own domain.

**Authentication**: Protect production documentation with authentication if needed. Configure in [Authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).

### Environment-specific configuration

Use environment variables or conditional content to manage environment-specific settings:

```mdx
{process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? (
  <Callout type="info">Production environment</Callout>
) : (
  <Callout type="warning">Preview environment</Callout>
)}
```

## Deployment best practices

Follow these practices to maintain reliable and efficient deployment workflows.

### Branch strategy

**Feature branches**: Create dedicated branches for significant updates or new sections. Use descriptive names like `feature/api-v2-docs` or `update/authentication-guide`.

**Deployment branch protection**: Enable branch protection rules on your deployment branch to require:
- Pull request reviews before merging
- Passing CI checks
- Up-to-date branches

### Pre-deployment validation

**Local testing**: Always run `mint dev` locally to catch build errors before pushing.

**Link validation**: Use the CLI link checker to find broken links:

```bash
mint dev --check-links
```

**Content review**: Review changes in preview deployments before merging to production.

### Deployment timing

**Off-peak deployments**: Schedule major updates during low-traffic periods to minimize user impact.

**Incremental updates**: Deploy small, frequent changes rather than large batches to reduce risk and simplify troubleshooting.

**Communication**: Notify users of significant documentation changes through changelogs or announcements.

### Quality gates

Implement quality gates to prevent problematic deployments:

1. **Required CI checks**: Set CI checks to `Blocking` level for critical validations
2. **Review requirements**: Require at least one approval before merging
3. **Automated testing**: Validate code examples and API references automatically

## Rollback strategies

Quickly revert problematic deployments to maintain documentation availability.

### Git-based rollback

The most reliable rollback method uses Git to revert changes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the problematic commit">
    Review your deployment history in the dashboard or Git log to find the commit that introduced issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revert the commit">
    Use Git to revert the problematic commit:
    ```bash
    git revert <commit-hash>
    git push origin <deployment-branch>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify deployment">
    Monitor the automatic deployment triggered by your revert commit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual redeployment

Trigger a manual deployment of a previous working state:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reset to previous commit">
    Checkout the last known good commit:
    ```bash
    git checkout <working-commit-hash>
    git push origin <deployment-branch> --force
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger deployment">
    If automatic deployment doesn't trigger, manually deploy from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Force pushing to your deployment branch can cause issues if others are working on the same branch. Coordinate with your team before force pushing.
</Warning>

### Preview-based rollback

Use preview deployments to validate rollback changes before applying to production:

1. Create a branch from the last working commit
2. Generate a preview deployment to verify functionality
3. Merge the rollback branch to your deployment branch

## Monitoring deployments

Track deployment status and identify issues quickly.

### Deployment dashboard

Monitor deployments in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com):

- **Deployment status**: View current and historical deployment status
- **Build logs**: Access detailed logs for failed deployments
- **Deployment history**: Track all deployments with timestamps and commit information

### Build failure troubleshooting

When deployments fail, check these common issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid docs.json syntax">
    Validate your `docs.json` file structure. Common issues include:
    - Missing commas between array elements
    - Incorrect navigation paths
    - Invalid property names
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing files">
    Ensure all files referenced in navigation exist in your repository:
    - Check file paths for typos
    - Verify file extensions match (`.mdx` not `.md`)
    - Confirm files are committed and pushed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid frontmatter">
    Check MDX file frontmatter for:
    - Proper YAML syntax
    - Required fields (title, description)
    - Valid property values
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Broken image links">
    Verify all image references:
    - Images exist in the repository
    - Paths are correct (relative or absolute)
    - Image files are committed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Performance monitoring

Track documentation performance metrics:

- **Build times**: Monitor deployment duration to identify performance issues
- **Analytics**: Use [analytics integrations](/optimize/analytics) to track user engagement
- **Feedback**: Enable [feedback features](/optimize/feedback) to gather user input

## Integrating with DevOps tools

Connect your documentation workflow with existing DevOps infrastructure.

### Continuous integration platforms

**GitHub Actions**: Create workflows that trigger on documentation changes:

```yaml .github/workflows/docs-check.yml
name: Documentation checks
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'docs/**'
      - 'docs.json'

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Mintlify CLI
        run: npm install -g mintlify
      - name: Check for broken links
        run: cd docs && mint dev --check-links
```

**GitLab CI**: Configure `.gitlab-ci.yml` for documentation validation:

```yaml
docs-validation:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm install -g mintlify
    - cd docs && mint dev --check-links
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

### Notification integrations

**Slack notifications**: Set up webhooks to notify teams of deployment events:

1. Create a Slack webhook in your workspace
2. Configure deployment notifications in your CI/CD pipeline
3. Receive alerts for successful deployments and failures

**Email notifications**: Organization admins automatically receive email notifications for:
- Deployment failures
- Deployment deletions
- Critical configuration changes

### Monitoring and alerting

**Status checks**: Integrate deployment status into your monitoring dashboard using the [Mintlify API](/api/update/status):

```bash
curl https://api.mintlify.com/v1/deployment/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

**Automated deployments**: Trigger deployments programmatically using the [deployment API](/api/update/trigger):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mintlify.com/v1/deployment/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Version control integration

**Monorepo support**: For monorepo setups, configure your documentation path in [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings). See [monorepo documentation](/deploy/monorepo) for detailed configuration.

**Submodules**: If your documentation lives in a Git submodule, ensure your CI/CD pipeline initializes submodules before deployment:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Advanced workflows

Implement sophisticated deployment patterns for complex documentation needs.

### Multi-language deployments

Deploy documentation in multiple languages using the [languages configuration](/organize/navigation#languages):

```json docs.json
{
  "languages": [
    {
      "language": "en",
      "groups": [{"group": "Getting started", "pages": ["en/quickstart"]}]
    },
    {
      "language": "es",
      "groups": [{"group": "Primeros pasos", "pages": ["es/quickstart"]}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Versioned documentation

Maintain multiple documentation versions using the [versions configuration](/organize/navigation#versions):

```json docs.json
{
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "groups": [{"group": "Getting started", "pages": ["v2/quickstart"]}]
    },
    {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "groups": [{"group": "Getting started", "pages": ["v1/quickstart"]}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Automated content updates

Use the [Mintlify Agent](/agent/index) to automate documentation updates:

- Sync API documentation with OpenAPI specifications
- Update code examples from repository changes
- Generate changelog entries from commit messages

### Blue-green deployments

Implement blue-green deployment patterns using preview deployments:

1. Deploy changes to a long-lived preview branch
2. Validate thoroughly in the preview environment
3. Swap preview to production by updating your deployment branch
4. Keep the previous version available for quick rollback
