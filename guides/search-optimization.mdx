title: Search optimization
description: Improve discoverability of your documentation through better search results

Mintlify provides built-in search functionality. This guide helps you optimize your content for better search results.

## How search works

Mintlify's search indexes:
- Page titles and descriptions
- Headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Body content
- Code block titles
- Component content

Search results are ranked by:
1. **Relevance**: How well the query matches the content
2. **Title matches**: Exact matches in titles rank higher
3. **Heading matches**: Matches in headings rank higher than body text
4. **Recency**: Recently updated pages may rank higher

## Optimize page metadata

### Write descriptive titles

**Good titles:**
- "Install the CLI"
- "Configure authentication"
- "Troubleshoot build errors"

**Poor titles:**
- "Getting Started" (too generic)
- "Page 1" (not descriptive)
- "CLI" (too short)

### Add meaningful descriptions

Descriptions appear in search results and help users decide if a page is relevant.

**Good description:**
```yaml
---
title: Install the CLI
description: Install the Mintlify CLI to preview and develop your documentation locally
---
```

**Poor description:**
```yaml
---
title: Install the CLI
description: Learn about the CLI
---
```

### Use relevant keywords

Add keywords to frontmatter for better discoverability:

```yaml
---
title: Install the CLI
description: Install the Mintlify CLI to preview and develop your documentation locally
keywords: ["CLI", "installation", "local development", "preview", "npm"]
---
```

## Structure content for search

### Use clear headings

Break content into sections with descriptive headings:

```mdx
## Install on macOS

Instructions for macOS...

## Install on Windows

Instructions for Windows...

## Install on Linux

Instructions for Linux...
```

This helps users find specific sections through search.

### Front-load important information

Place key information early in your content:

**Good:**
```mdx
The API key is required for authentication. Generate one in your dashboard settings.
```

**Poor:**
```mdx
To use our API, you'll need several things. First, make sure you have an account. Then, navigate to the settings. Finally, you can generate an API key for authentication.
```

### Use natural language

Write how users search. If users search "how to deploy", use that phrase in your content:

```mdx
## How to deploy your documentation

To deploy your documentation, push changes to your connected repository...
```

## Improve content discoverability

### Create overview pages

Add overview pages for major sections:

```mdx
---
title: API reference overview
description: Complete reference for all API endpoints, authentication, and error handling
---

Our API provides programmatic access to your documentation. This section covers:

- [Authentication](/api/authentication) - API keys and security
- [Endpoints](/api/endpoints) - Available API operations
- [Rate limits](/api/rate-limits) - Usage quotas and limits
- [Error handling](/api/errors) - Common errors and solutions
```

### Add cross-references

Link related pages to improve navigation:

```mdx
<Info>
  New to Mintlify? Start with the [quickstart guide](/quickstart) before configuring advanced features.
</Info>
```

### Use synonyms

Include alternative terms users might search for:

```mdx
## Environment variables (env vars)

Configure environment variables to customize your deployment...
```

## Optimize for common queries

### Answer questions directly

Structure content to answer common questions:

```mdx
## How do I add a custom domain?

To add a custom domain:

1. Go to your dashboard settings
2. Click "Custom domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Update your DNS records
```

### Include troubleshooting

Add troubleshooting sections for common issues:

```mdx
## Troubleshooting

### Images not loading

If images don't appear:
- Verify the image path is correct
- Check that images are committed to Git
- Ensure file names don't contain spaces
```

### Document error messages

Include actual error messages users might search for:

```mdx
## "Module not found" error

If you see `Error: Cannot find module 'mintlify'`:

1. Reinstall the CLI: `npm install -g mintlify`
2. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Try again
```

## Technical optimization

### Keep pages focused

Each page should cover one topic thoroughly rather than multiple topics superficially.

**Good structure:**
```
/authentication/overview
/authentication/api-keys
/authentication/oauth
/authentication/jwt
```

**Poor structure:**
```
/authentication (covers everything)
```

### Use descriptive URLs

Page paths affect search relevance:

**Good:**
```
/api-playground/openapi-setup
/deploy/custom-domain
/troubleshooting/build-errors
```

**Poor:**
```
/page1
/docs/item
/misc/other
```

### Avoid duplicate content

Don't repeat the same information across multiple pages. Instead:
- Create one authoritative page
- Link to it from other pages
- Use snippets for shared content

## Search best practices

### Include code examples

Code examples improve search results for technical queries:

```mdx
## Install with npm

```bash
npm install -g mintlify
```

## Install with pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -g mintlify
```
```

### Add alt text to images

Alt text is indexed by search:

```mdx
![Dashboard showing deployment status with green checkmark](/images/deployment-success.png)
```

### Use tables for comparisons

Tables help users find specific information:

```mdx
| Plan | Rate Limit | Price |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Free | 100/min | $0 |
| Pro | 1000/min | $99/mo |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |
```

## Monitor search performance

### Check search analytics

Review search queries in your analytics to:
- Identify common searches
- Find gaps in documentation
- Discover confusing terminology

### Test your search

Regularly search for common terms to verify:
- Relevant pages appear in results
- Results are ranked appropriately
- No broken links in results

### Update based on feedback

If users report difficulty finding information:
1. Review the page's title and description
2. Add relevant keywords
3. Improve heading structure
4. Add cross-references

## Common search issues

### Page not appearing in results

**Causes:**
- Page not in navigation (hidden pages aren't indexed)
- Missing or poor title/description
- Recently published (wait 5-10 minutes for indexing)

**Solutions:**
- Add page to navigation in `docs.json`
- Improve frontmatter metadata
- Redeploy to trigger reindexing

### Wrong pages ranking high

**Causes:**
- Generic titles across multiple pages
- Keyword stuffing
- Duplicate content

**Solutions:**
- Make titles more specific
- Use natural language
- Consolidate duplicate content

### Search showing outdated content

**Causes:**
- Search index not updated
- Cached results

**Solutions:**
- Redeploy your documentation
- Wait 10-15 minutes for index update
- Clear browser cache
