<Tip>
This page explains fundamental strategies to optimize your documentation SEO.
</Tip>

## Content basics

Make your writing and structure easy for search engines to scan.

### Heading hierarchy

Use sequential, meaningful headers to structure your content. Each page has an H1 created from the `title:` property in the frontmatter. Follow these best practices:

- Use only one H1 per page (automatically generated from frontmatter)
- Follow a logical hierarchy: H1 → H2 → H3 (don't skip levels)
- Include relevant keywords in headings naturally
- Keep headings descriptive and concise (under 70 characters)
- Use sentence case for consistency

### Content structure

Break down large chunks of text into easily readable sections:

- **Short paragraphs:** Aim for 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- **Bullet points and lists:** Use for scannable information
- **Code examples:** Include practical, working examples
- **Visual aids:** Add diagrams, screenshots, or videos where helpful
- **Tables:** Organize comparative or structured data

### Internal linking strategy

Link to related content using descriptive anchor text:

- Use descriptive anchor text: "Learn more about [rate limiting](/api/rate-limits)" instead of "Click here"
- Link to related pages within your documentation to create topic clusters
- Add contextual links within body content, not just at the end
- Ensure all important pages are linked from at least one other page
- Use relative paths for internal links to maintain portability

## Technical SEO basics

Once your content is optimized, ensure your documentation performs well from a technical standpoint.

### Meta tags and descriptions

Craft SEO-friendly titles and descriptions for each page. Most [meta tags](/optimize/seo) are automatically generated, but you can customize them:

- **Title tags:** Keep between 50-60 characters to avoid truncation in search results
- **Meta descriptions:** Write compelling descriptions between 150-160 characters
- **Include target keywords:** Place primary keywords near the beginning
- **Make each unique:** Every page should have a distinct title and description
- **Match user intent:** Describe what users will learn or accomplish

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "API authentication guide"
description: "Learn how to authenticate API requests using OAuth 2.0, API keys, and JWT tokens with code examples."
keywords: ["API authentication", "OAuth 2.0", "JWT", "API keys"]
---
```

### Image optimization

Provide descriptive alt text for images with relevant keywords:

- Use descriptive file names: `oauth-flow-diagram.png` instead of `image1.png`
- Write meaningful alt text: "OAuth 2.0 API authentication flow diagram" instead of "diagram"
- Keep alt text under 125 characters
- Don't start with "image of" or "picture of"
- Include keywords naturally without stuffing
- Compress images to reduce file size (use WebP or AVIF formats)

### Sitemaps and indexing

Mintlify automatically generates a sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`:

- Sitemaps are automatically updated when you deploy
- Submit your sitemap to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) to speed up indexing
- Use the `seo.indexing` field in `docs.json` to control which pages are included
- Monitor indexing status and fix any crawl errors in Search Console

### URL structure

Create clean, descriptive URLs:

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens (not underscores)
- Keep URLs short and descriptive: `/api/authentication` not `/api/auth-guide-v2-final`
- Follow a logical hierarchy that matches your navigation
- Avoid special characters, spaces, or unnecessary parameters
- Use consistent patterns across your documentation

## Page performance

Page speed is a critical ranking factor. Use tools like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) and [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org) to identify areas for improvement.

### Core Web Vitals

Focus on these key metrics that Google uses for ranking:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Should occur within 2.5 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID):** Should be less than 100 milliseconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Should be less than 0.1

### Performance optimization

- **Optimize media:** Compress images using WebP or AVIF formats
- **Lazy load images:** Load images only when they enter the viewport
- **Minimize JavaScript:** Remove unused code and defer non-critical scripts
- **Enable caching:** Leverage browser caching for static assets
- **Use a CDN:** Serve content from geographically distributed servers
- **Target load time:** Aim for pages to load in under 3 seconds

### Structured data (schema markup)

Add schema markup to help search engines better understand and rank your content:

- **HowTo schema:** For step-by-step guides and tutorials
- **FAQ schema:** For frequently asked questions
- **Article schema:** For blog posts and documentation articles
- **BreadcrumbList schema:** For navigation breadcrumbs
- **SoftwareApplication schema:** For API and SDK documentation

Test your structured data using [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results).

### Mobile optimization

Ensure your documentation works well on mobile devices:

- Use responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Ensure text is readable without zooming (minimum 16px font size)
- Make tap targets at least 48x48 pixels
- Avoid horizontal scrolling
- Test on real devices, not just emulators

## Keyword research

To increase organic traffic, invest time into understanding which keywords help users land on your documentation.

- **Keyword research:** Use free tools like [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/tools/keyword-planner/) or [Keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com) to identify common phrases or long-tail keywords.
- **Integrate keywords naturally:** Add keywords naturally into headings, subheadings, and throughout the body text. Don't overstuff keywords. Your documentation should be written for your users, not search engines.
