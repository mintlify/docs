This page explains fundamental strategies to optimize your documentation SEO.
</Tip>

## Content fundamentals

Structure content for search engines and readers:

- **Headings and subheadings**: Use sequential, meaningful headers. Each page has an H1 from the `title:` property in frontmatter.
- **Short paragraphs and lists**: Break large text blocks into readable sections. Use bullet points and numbered lists.
- **Internal linking**: Link to related content with descriptive anchor text. Write "Learn more about rate limiting" instead of "Click here."

## Technical SEO essentials

Optimize technical elements for better discoverability:

- **Meta tags and descriptions**: Write SEO-friendly titles (50-60 characters) and descriptions (150-160 characters). Most [meta tags](/optimize/seo) are automatically generated.
- **Alt text for images**: Include descriptive alt text with relevant keywords. Write "OAuth 2.0 API authentication flow" instead of "diagram" to improve SEO and accessibility.
- **Sitemaps**: Mintlify automatically generates sitemaps. Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console to accelerate indexing.

## Page performance

Use tools like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) to identify areas for technical SEO improvement.

Examples of more advanced optimizations: 

- **Optimize media for speed:** Compress images using formats like WebP or AVIF and ensure your pages load quickly (ideally under 3 seconds).
- **Structured data (schema markup):** Add schema markup (like HowTo, FAQ) to your pages to help search engines better understand and rank your content.

## Keyword research

Understand which keywords drive users to your documentation:

- **Research keywords**: Use tools like [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/tools/keyword-planner/) or [Keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com) to identify common phrases and long-tail keywords.
- **Integrate naturally**: Add keywords to headings, subheadings, and body text where they fit naturally. Avoid keyword stuffing. Write for users, not search engines.
