<Tip>
  This page explains stylistic choices, common mistakes, and implementation tips for writing technical documentation. 
</Tip>

## Writing principles

- **Be concise**: Users read documentation to achieve goals. Get to the point quickly.
- **Prioritize clarity**: Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon and complex sentences.
- **Use active voice**: Write "Create a configuration file" instead of "A configuration file should be created."
- **Make content skimmable**: Use clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet points for easy scanning.
- **Write in second person**: Address readers as "you" to make instructions easier to follow and more personal.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Spelling and grammar errors**: Even minor mistakes reduce credibility and readability.
- **Inconsistent terminology**: Switching between "API key" and "API token" confuses users. Use consistent terms throughout.
- **Product-centric language**: Users lack internal context. Use familiar language that aligns with how they think.
- **Colloquialisms**: Avoid informal expressions, especially in documentation intended for localization. They reduce clarity.

## Tips for enforcing style

Leverage existing style guides to standardize your documentation:

- [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
- [Splunk Style Guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Howtouse)
- [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)

When you know which writing principles you want to implement, automate as much as you can. You can use  [CI checks](/deploy/ci) or linters like [Vale](https://vale.sh).
