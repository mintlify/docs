## Writing principles

- **Be concise.** People are reading documentation to achieve a goal. Get to the point quickly.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Be simple, direct, and avoid jargon or complex sentence structure.
- **Use active voice.** Instead of saying "A configuration file should be created," use "Create a configuration file."
- **Be skimmable.** Use headlines to orient readers. Break up text-heavy paragraphs. Use bullet points and lists to make it easier to scan.
- **Write in second person.** Referring to your reader makes it easier to follow instructions and makes the documentation feel more personal.

## Common writing mistakes

- **Spelling and grammar mistakes.** Even a few spelling and grammar mistakes in your documentation make it less credible and harder to read.
- **Inconsistent terminology.** Calling something an “API key” in one paragraph then “API token” in the next makes it difficult for users to follow along.
- **Product-centric terminology.** Your users don't have the full context of your product. Use language that users are familiar with.
- **Colloquialisms.** Especially for localization, colloquialisms hurt clarity.

## Tips for enforcing style

Leverage existing style guides to standardize your documentation:

- [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
- [Splunk Style Guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Howtouse)
- [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)

When you know which writing principles you want to implement, automate as much as you can. You can use  [CI checks](/deploy/ci) or linters like [Vale](https://vale.sh).
