## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up Auth0 as an authentication provider for your Mintlify documentation. By the end, your users will be able to log in to your documentation using their Auth0 credentials.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Regular Web Application in Auth0">
    Log in to your Auth0 dashboard and navigate to **Applications** > **Applications**. Click the **Create Application** button, give your application a name (e.g., "Mintlify"), and select **Regular Web Applications** as the application type. Then click **Create**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get client information">
    After creating your application, you'll be taken to the application settings page. Here, you'll find the essential credentials needed for the OAuth integration:

    Make note of the following information:
    - **Domain**: This is your Auth0 tenant domain (e.g., `your-tenant.auth0.com`)
    - **Client ID**: The public identifier for your application
    - **Client Secret**: The secret key for your application (keep this secure)
    
    You'll need these values for configuring Mintlify in the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Mintlify client">
    Navigate to your Mintlify Dashboard and go to the **Settings** > **Authentication** section. Select **OAuth** as your authentication method and you'll see the OAuth configuration form:

    Fill in the form with the following values:
    
    - **Authorization URL**: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/authorize` (replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with your actual Auth0 domain from step 2)
    - **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID from your Auth0 application
    - **Client Secret**: Enter the Client Secret from your Auth0 application
    - **Scopes**: Leave blank unless you have custom scopes set in Auth0
    - **Token URL**: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/oauth/token` (replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with your actual Auth0 domain)
    
    After filling in these details, click **Save changes** to store your OAuth configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Callback URL">
    Mintlify will generate a unique Redirect URL that Auth0 needs to recognize for the OAuth flow to work properly.
    
    Copy the Redirect URL from your Mintlify Dashboard's Authentication settings:

    Return to your Auth0 application settings page, scroll down to the **Application URIs** section, and paste the Redirect URL into the **Allowed Callback URLs** field:

    Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the Auth0 page to apply this configuration.
