When you create accessible documentation, you prioritize content design that makes your documentation usable by as many people as possible regardless of how they access and interact with your documentation.

Accessible documentation improves the user experience for everyone. Your content is more clear, better structured, and easier to navigate.

This guide offers some best practices for creating accessible documentation, but it is not exhaustive. You should consider accessibility an ongoing process. Technologies and standards change over time, which introduce new opportunities to improve documentation.

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility (sometimes abbreviated as a11y for the number of letters between the first and last letters of "accessibility") is intentionally designing and building websites and tools that as many people as possible can use. This includes people who:

- Use screen readers and other assistive technologies
- Navigate using only a keyboard
- Have low vision or color blindness
- Access your website on mobile devices or slow networks

Accessible documentation follows web accessibility standards, primarily the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/). These guidelines help ensure your content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

## Getting started with accessibility

Making your documentation accessible doesn't have to happen all at once. You can approach it in phases, starting with high-impact changes and building from there.

### Do this right now

These three actions will immediately improve your documentation's accessibility:

1. **Run `mint a11y`** to identify issues in your current content
2. **Add alt text** to images on your most-visited pages
3. **Check your heading hierarchy** to ensure you have one H1 per page and headings follow sequential order (H2, then H3, not H2 to H4)

### Plan your accessibility work

Rather than trying to fix everything at once, work in phases:

**Week 1: Images and structure**
- Review all images for descriptive alt text
- Audit link text and replace generic phrases like "click here"
- Fix heading hierarchy issues across your documentation

**Month 1: Navigation and media**
- Test keyboard navigation on your key pages
- Add captions or transcripts to embedded videos
- Review color contrast if you use a custom theme

**Ongoing: Build it into your workflow**
- Run `mint a11y` before publishing new content
- Include accessibility checks in your content review process
- Test keyboard navigation when adding interactive features
- Verify new external links and embeds include proper titles and descriptions

Starting small and building accessibility into your regular workflow makes it sustainable. Each improvement helps more users access your documentation successfully.

## Write descriptive alt text

Alt text makes images accessible to screen reader users and appears when images fail to load. Every image in your documentation should have alt text that describes both its content and purpose.

### Write effective alt text

- **Be specific**: Describe what the image shows, not just that it's an image
- **Include context**: Explain why the image matters in relation to the surrounding content
- **Keep it concise**: Aim for one to two sentences
- **Avoid redundancy**: Don't start with "Image of" or "Picture of"

```mdx
<!-- Good -->
![Dashboard showing three active projects and two pending invitations](/images/dashboard.png)

<!-- Not helpful -->
![Dashboard screenshot](/images/dashboard.png)
```

### Add alt text to images

For Markdown images, include alt text in the square brackets:

```mdx
![Description of the image](/path/to/image.png)
```

For HTML images, use the `alt` attribute:

```html
<img
  src="/images/screenshot.png"
  alt="Settings panel with accessibility options enabled"
/>
```

### Add titles to embedded content

Iframes and video embeds need descriptive titles:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example"
  title="Tutorial: Setting up your first documentation site"
></iframe>
```

## Structure your content

Well-structured content is easier to navigate and understand, especially for screen reader users who rely on headings to move through pages.

### Use proper heading hierarchy

Start with one H1 (your page title) and use heading levels in order without skipping:

```mdx
# Page title (H1)

## Main section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

### Another subsection (H3)

## Another main section (H2)
```

Don't skip from H2 to H4, and don't choose headings based on visual appearance. Use headings to reflect your content structure.

### Write descriptive link text

Link text should make sense on its own. Avoid generic phrases like "click here" or "read more."

```mdx
<!-- Good -->
Learn how to [configure your navigation](/organize/navigation).

<!-- Unclear -->
To configure your navigation, [click here](/organize/navigation).
```

### Keep content scannable

- Break up long paragraphs
- Use bulleted or numbered lists for steps and options
- Highlight key information with callouts (Tip, Note, Warning components)
- Use tables for structured data, but keep them simple

### Use proper table structure

When using tables, include headers so screen readers can associate data with the correct column:

```mdx
| Feature | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| Search  | Active |
| Analytics | Active |
```

## Design for readability

Visual design choices affect how accessible your documentation is to users with low vision, color blindness, or other visual disabilities.

### Ensure sufficient color contrast

Mintlify's default themes meet WCAG contrast requirements, but if you customize colors, verify contrast ratios:

- Body text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- Interactive elements: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

Test both light and dark mode if you customize your theme colors.

### Don't rely on color alone

If you use color to convey information, include a text label or icon as well. For example, don't mark errors only with red textalso include an error icon or the word "Error."

### Use clear, concise language

- Write in plain language
- Define technical terms when first used
- Keep sentences focused and direct
- Use active voice

## Make code examples accessible

Code blocks are a core part of technical documentation, but they require specific accessibility considerations to ensure screen reader users can understand them.

### Specify the programming language

Always declare the language for syntax highlighting. This helps screen readers announce the code context to users:

````mdx
```javascript
function getUserData(id) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
}
```
````

Without language specification, screen readers may attempt to pronounce code as regular text, making it difficult to understand.

### Provide context around code

Screen reader users can't scan code visually, so provide clear context before and after code blocks:

```mdx
The following function fetches user data from the API:

```javascript
function getUserData(id) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
}
```

This returns a promise that resolves to the user object.
```

Describe what the code does, what it accepts, and what it returns. This helps all users understand the example faster.

### Keep code examples focused

- Break long code examples into smaller, logical chunks
- Comment complex logic within the code
- Consider providing a text description for complex algorithms
- When showing file structure, use actual code blocks with language labels rather than ASCII art

## Video and multimedia accessibility

Videos, animations, and other multimedia content need text alternatives so all users can access the information they contain.

### Add captions to videos

Captions make video content accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing. They also help users in sound-sensitive environments and non-native speakers:

- Use captions for all spoken content in videos
- Include relevant sound effects in captions (e.g., "[keyboard typing]")
- Ensure captions are synchronized with the audio
- Use proper punctuation and speaker identification when multiple people speak

Most video hosting platforms (YouTube, Vimeo) support adding captions. Upload caption files or use auto-generated captions as a starting point, then review for accuracy.

### Provide transcripts

Transcripts offer an alternative way to access video content. They're searchable, easier to reference, and accessible to screen readers:

```mdx
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example"
  title="Tutorial: Setting up authentication"
></iframe>

<Accordion title="Video transcript">
In this tutorial, we'll walk through setting up authentication...
</Accordion>
```

Place transcripts near the video or provide a clear link to access them.

### Use descriptive titles for embeds

Every iframe and embedded element needs a title that describes its content:

```html
<!-- Good -->
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example"
  title="Tutorial: Configuring your API endpoints"
></iframe>

<!-- Not helpful -->
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example"
  title="Video"
></iframe>
```

The title should be specific enough that a user can decide whether to interact with the embed.

### Consider alternatives to video-only content

If critical information only appears in a video:

- Provide the same information in text form
- Include key screenshots with descriptive alt text
- Create a written tutorial that covers the same material

This ensures users who can't access video content can still complete their task.

## Make AI features accessible

AI-powered features like chatbots and search require specific accessibility considerations to ensure keyboard users and screen reader users can interact with them effectively.

### Ensure keyboard access

All AI features must be fully operable with a keyboard:

- Users should reach the chat interface by pressing `Tab`
- `Enter` or `Space` should open the chat
- `Escape` should close the chat and return focus to the trigger element
- `Tab` should move through chat elements (input field, messages, buttons)
- Arrow keys should navigate through chat history when appropriate

Test every interaction with keyboard only to verify nothing requires a mouse.

### Manage focus properly

When the AI chat opens or closes, focus should move logically:

- Opening chat should move focus to the input field
- Closing chat should return focus to the element that opened it
- New AI responses should not steal focus from where the user is working
- If the user is typing, focus should remain in the input field

Poor focus management forces users to navigate back to where they were, creating frustration and inefficiency.

### Announce dynamic content

AI responses appear dynamically, so screen readers need to be notified:

```html
<!-- Use ARIA live regions for AI responses -->
<div role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  <!-- AI response content appears here -->
</div>
```

- Use `aria-live="polite"` so announcements don't interrupt the user
- Use `aria-atomic="true"` to announce the complete response, not just changes
- Provide a clear indication when the AI is thinking or loading a response

### Provide alternative access

Not all users can or want to use a chat interface:

- Ensure AI-generated content is also available through traditional navigation
- Provide clear labels for AI-suggested links or actions
- Allow users to disable or minimize AI features if they interfere with their workflow
- Consider a text-based command interface as an alternative to conversational chat

### Label AI-generated content clearly

Users should know when they're interacting with AI:

- Use clear labels like "AI Assistant" or "Ask AI"
- Mark AI-generated responses distinctly from human-written documentation
- Provide context about what the AI can and cannot help with
- Include a way to report inaccurate AI responses

This helps users set appropriate expectations and trust the information they receive.

## Test your documentation

Regular testing helps you catch accessibility issues before users encounter them.

### Check for accessibility issues with `mint a11y`

Use the `mint a11y` CLI command to automatically scan your documentation for common accessibility issues:

```bash
mint a11y
```

The command checks for:

- Missing alt text on images
- Improper heading hierarchy
- Empty links or buttons
- Insufficient color contrast
- Other WCAG violations

When the scan completes, review the reported issues and fix them in your content. Run the command again to verify your fixes.

<Tip>
  Run `mint a11y` regularly as part of your documentation workflow to catch accessibility issues early.
</Tip>

### Basic keyboard navigation test

Navigate through your documentation using only your keyboard:

1. Press `Tab` to move forward through interactive elements
2. Press `Shift + Tab` to move backward
3. Press `Enter` to activate links and buttons
4. Verify all interactive elements are reachable and have visible focus indicators

If you can't access something with the keyboard, users with motor disabilities won't be able to either.

### Go deeper with accessibility testing

For more comprehensive testing:

- **Screen readers**: Test with [NVDA (Windows)](https://www.nvaccess.org/) or [VoiceOver (Mac)](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/)
- **Browser extensions**: Install [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) or [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) to scan pages for issues
- **WCAG guidelines**: Review the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) for detailed standards

The more you test, the more confident you can be that your documentation works for everyone.
