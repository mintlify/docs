Accessible documentation is created with consideration for all users, including those with disabilities that may make it difficult or impossible to use some web technologies. When you consider accessibility, you create content that is better for everyone. Your content is more clear, better structured, and easier to navigate whether they use assistive technologies or not.

This guide offers some best practices for creating accessible documentation, but it is not exhaustive. You should consider accessibility an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Technologies change. Standards change. And we can always improve our content.

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility (sometimes abbreviated as a11y for the number of letters between the first and last letters of "accessibility") means ensuring your documentation can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. This includes people who:

- Use screen readers to navigate content
- Navigate using only a keyboard
- Have low vision or color blindness
- Have cognitive or learning disabilities
- Use other assistive technologies

Accessible documentation follows web accessibility standards, primarily the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/). These guidelines help ensure your content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

When you make your documentation accessible, you also make it better for everyone. Clear structure, descriptive headings, and readable text benefit all users, not just those using assistive technologies.

## Write descriptive alt text

Alt text makes images accessible to screen reader users and appears when images fail to load. Every image in your documentation should have alt text that describes both its content and purpose.

### Write effective alt text

- **Be specific**: Describe what the image shows, not just that it's an image
- **Include context**: Explain why the image matters in relation to the surrounding content
- **Keep it concise**: Aim for one to two sentences
- **Avoid redundancy**: Don't start with "Image of" or "Picture of"

```mdx
<!-- Good -->
![Dashboard showing three active projects and two pending invitations](/images/dashboard.png)

<!-- Not helpful -->
![Dashboard screenshot](/images/dashboard.png)
```

### Add alt text to images

For Markdown images, include alt text in the square brackets:

```mdx
![Description of the image](/path/to/image.png)
```

For HTML images, use the `alt` attribute:

```html
<img
  src="/images/screenshot.png"
  alt="Settings panel with accessibility options enabled"
/>
```

### Add titles to embedded content

Iframes and video embeds need descriptive titles:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example"
  title="Tutorial: Setting up your first documentation site"
></iframe>
```

## Structure your content

Well-structured content is easier to navigate and understand, especially for screen reader users who rely on headings to move through pages.

### Use proper heading hierarchy

Start with one H1 (your page title) and use heading levels in order without skipping:

```mdx
# Page title (H1)

## Main section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

### Another subsection (H3)

## Another main section (H2)
```

Don't skip from H2 to H4, and don't choose headings based on visual appearance. Use headings to reflect your content structure.

### Write descriptive link text

Link text should make sense on its own. Avoid generic phrases like "click here" or "read more."

```mdx
<!-- Good -->
Learn how to [configure your navigation](/organize/navigation).

<!-- Unclear -->
To configure your navigation, [click here](/organize/navigation).
```

### Keep content scannable

- Break up long paragraphs
- Use bulleted or numbered lists for steps and options
- Highlight key information with callouts (Tip, Note, Warning components)
- Use tables for structured data, but keep them simple

### Use proper table structure

When using tables, include headers so screen readers can associate data with the correct column:

```mdx
| Feature | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| Search  | Active |
| Analytics | Active |
```

## Design for readability

Visual design choices affect how accessible your documentation is to users with low vision, color blindness, or other visual disabilities.

### Ensure sufficient color contrast

Mintlify's default themes meet WCAG contrast requirements, but if you customize colors, verify contrast ratios:

- Body text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- Interactive elements: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

Test both light and dark mode if you customize your theme colors.

### Don't rely on color alone

If you use color to convey information, include a text label or icon as well. For example, don't mark errors only with red textalso include an error icon or the word "Error."

### Use clear, concise language

- Write in plain language
- Define technical terms when first used
- Keep sentences focused and direct
- Use active voice

## Test your documentation

Regular testing helps you catch accessibility issues before users encounter them.

### Check for accessibility issues with `mint a11y`

Use the `mint a11y` CLI command to automatically scan your documentation for common accessibility issues:

```bash
mint a11y
```

The command checks for:

- Missing alt text on images
- Improper heading hierarchy
- Empty links or buttons
- Insufficient color contrast
- Other WCAG violations

When the scan completes, review the reported issues and fix them in your content. Run the command again to verify your fixes.

<Tip>
  Run `mint a11y` regularly as part of your documentation workflow to catch accessibility issues early.

### Basic keyboard navigation test

Navigate through your documentation using only your keyboard:

1. Press `Tab` to move forward through interactive elements
2. Press `Shift + Tab` to move backward
3. Press `Enter` to activate links and buttons
4. Verify all interactive elements are reachable and have visible focus indicators

If you can't access something with the keyboard, users with motor disabilities won't be able to either.

### Go deeper with accessibility testing

For more comprehensive testing:

- **Screen readers**: Test with [NVDA (Windows)](https://www.nvaccess.org/) or [VoiceOver (Mac)](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/)
- **Browser extensions**: Install [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) or [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) to scan pages for issues
- **WCAG guidelines**: Review the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) for detailed standards

The more you test, the more confident you can be that your documentation works for everyone.
