Introduction (goal-oriented)

What you'll accomplish: Deploy your organization's KB on Mintlify with authentication, search, and proper IA
Who this is for: Technical writers, IT teams, documentation leads at companies with 50+ employees
Prerequisites: Existing KB content, authentication system, domain control

Main sections (task-focused):

Preparing your knowledge base for migration

Audit existing content structure
Export content from current platform
Map taxonomy to Mintlify's navigation structure
Identify authentication requirements


Setting up authentication for internal access

Configure SSO/OAuth integration
Set up user info endpoint
Handle CORS for cross-domain scenarios
Test authentication flow


Structuring your navigation for KB use

Organize by department vs by content type
Handle deep hierarchies (KBs often have 3-4+ levels)
Implement search-first vs browse-first IA
Configure versioning if needed


Optimizing search for knowledge discovery

Enable AI search features
Configure search filters (department, type, date)
Set up search analytics to track common queries
Handle multiple content formats (PDFs, videos, etc.)


Integrating with existing tools

Slack integration for in-flow access
Link from internal dashboard/intranet
Embed KB search in support tools
Set up API access for programmatic queries


Establishing maintenance workflows

Assign content ownership by department
Set up review cycles and content verification
Create contribution guidelines
Monitor usage metrics


For Claude:
How-to guide best practices to follow:

Focus on the goal (hosting a KB), not explaining Mintlify features generally
Assume competence — no need to explain what SSO is
Provide concrete steps but allow for judgment (e.g., "choose an IA that matches how your users think about topics")
Link out to reference docs rather than explaining every parameter
Address real-world complications (legacy content, change management, stakeholder buy-in)
Include decision points ("If you need department-specific permissions, configure...")

Things to avoid (per Diataxis):

Don't explain why KBs are important (that's Explanation)
Don't teach how to use Mintlify from scratch (that's Tutorial)
Don't list every configuration option (that's Reference)
Keep focus tight on the enterprise KB hosting scenario
