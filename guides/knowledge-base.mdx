## Introduction

This guide shows you how to create an internal knowledge base on Mintlify. You'll set up a navigation structure, migrate or create content, configure access controls, and establish a maintenance process.

Whether you're migrating an existing knowledge base or starting from scratch, this guide covers everything you need to get started.

### Prerequisites

- An authentication system (SSO or OAuth provider like Okta or Azure AD)
- Control over your domain for hosting
- Admin access to your Mintlify organization

## Design the navigation structure for your knowledge base

Your knowledge base's navigation structure determines how users find content. In this section, you'll choose an organization pattern and create a `docs.json` file that defines your knowledge base's navigation structure.

<Tip>
  The navigation structure you choose will impact how your team finds information in your knowledge base. Consider how your team thinks about the content and choose a structure that makes sense for your team.
</Tip>

### Choose between department and topic-based organization

Your KB structure should match how users think about the content. Choose one:

**Department-based**: Top-level sections for Finance, HR, Engineering, Legal, etc. Use this if:
- Teams work in silos and need their own documentation
- Different departments have their own governance and review cycles
- Users primarily care about their own department's information

**Topic-based**: Top-level sections for Policies, Processes, FAQs, Guides, etc. Use this if:
- Users need cross-functional knowledge (an engineer might need to understand HR onboarding)
- Content overlaps between teams
- You have a lot of content that's relevant to everyone

### Implement your structure in docs.json

Your `docs.json` file defines how your KB is organized. Create this file at the root of your project repository.

**Department-based example:**

```json
{
  "name": "Company Knowledge Base",
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Finance",
      "pages": [
        "finance/overview",
        "finance/budgeting-process",
        "finance/expense-reports",
        "finance/cost-allocation"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "HR",
      "pages": [
        "hr/overview",
        "hr/onboarding",
        "hr/benefits",
        "hr/time-off-policy"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "Engineering",
      "pages": [
        "engineering/overview",
        "engineering/dev-setup",
        "engineering/deployment",
        "engineering/code-standards"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With this structure, your files on disk should look like:

```
docs/
├── docs.json
├── finance/
│   ├── overview.mdx
│   ├── budgeting-process.mdx
│   ├── expense-reports.mdx
│   └── cost-allocation.mdx
├── hr/
│   ├── overview.mdx
│   ├── onboarding.mdx
│   ├── benefits.mdx
│   └── time-off-policy.mdx
└── engineering/
    ├── overview.mdx
    ├── dev-setup.mdx
    ├── deployment.mdx
    └── code-standards.mdx
```

**Content-type-based example:**

```json
{
  "name": "Company Knowledge Base",
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Policies",
      "pages": [
        "policies/code-of-conduct",
        "policies/remote-work",
        "policies/time-off",
        "policies/expenses"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "Processes",
      "pages": [
        "processes/hiring",
        "processes/onboarding",
        "processes/project-kickoff",
        "processes/procurement"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "FAQs",
      "pages": [
        "faqs/benefits",
        "faqs/it-support",
        "faqs/facilities"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With this structure, your files on disk should look like:

```
docs/
├── docs.json
├── policies/
│   ├── code-of-conduct.mdx
│   ├── remote-work.mdx
│   ├── time-off.mdx
│   └── expenses.mdx
├── processes/
│   ├── hiring.mdx
│   ├── onboarding.mdx
│   ├── project-kickoff.mdx
│   └── procurement.mdx
└── faqs/
    ├── benefits.mdx
    ├── it-support.mdx
    └── facilities.mdx
```

### File naming and organization

Follow these conventions for your KB files:

- Use lowercase filenames with hyphens: `expense-reports.mdx`, not `Expense Reports.mdx`
- File path in docs.json should match the folder structure: `finance/budgeting-process` maps to `finance/budgeting-process.mdx`
- Create one `.mdx` file per article
- Group related articles in folders (finance/, hr/, policies/, etc.)

### Handle deep hierarchies

If your KB has 4+ nested levels, flatten it by:
- Moving lower-level articles up one or two levels
- Combining related articles into fewer, longer pages
- Using search (configured in a later section) to help users find content instead of relying on navigation

For example, restructure from: `HR → Policies → Benefits → Health Insurance → Medical Plans → Coverage Details` to: `HR → Benefits → Coverage Details`

### Start with browse-first navigation

Begin with a clear, organized structure that users can browse. We'll optimize for search later. New employees especially benefit from being able to explore your KB's structure to understand how the company works.

Later, you can add search filters by department, content type, or other metadata to handle search-first users who know what they're looking for.

## Organize and prepare your content

In this section, you'll audit your content, export it, and create your first articles in the structure you designed.

### Audit your existing content

If you're migrating an existing KB, start by cataloging what you have:

- Total number of articles
- Current information architecture
- Content types you're using (text, PDFs, videos, embedded content)
- Metadata you're tracking (dates, authors, tags, departments)
- Search patterns (what do people search for most?)

If you're building a new KB, plan what you need:

- What topics need documentation?
- Who will contribute content?
- What's the priority order for getting content in place?

<Tip>
  Whether migrating or starting fresh, this is a good time to reorganize. Compare your current/planned content against the structure you designed in the previous section. Does it match? Can you improve it?
</Tip>

### Export or prepare your content

**If migrating**: Most knowledge base platforms support exporting content in standard formats:

- Export to **Markdown** for the simplest migration to Mintlify
- Export to **HTML** if Markdown isn't available (you'll convert it to Markdown later)
- Export to **JSON or CSV** if you have structured metadata to preserve

Keep the folder structure intact during export—it will help you organize content into your docs.json structure.

**If starting fresh**: Skip this step and move to creating your first articles.

### Add content to your knowledge base

Move existing content into the appropriate folders in your project repository. Create any new files as needed.

## Set up authentication for internal access

Mintlify supports authentication through OpenID Connect (OIDC), which works with most enterprise SSO providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Auth0, and others).

### Plan your authentication approach

First, decide who needs access and what level of permissions they need:

**Simple SSO**: All authenticated employees get full access to your entire KB. Use this if:
- Your KB isn't sensitive (or is only accessible internally anyway)
- You don't need department-specific content restrictions
- You want the fastest setup

With simple SSO, anyone logged into your domain can see everything. This is the easiest option.

**Department-level permissions**: Different employees see different KB sections based on their department or role. Use this if:
- Finance articles should only be visible to Finance employees
- You have sensitive content that needs restricted access
- You're handling compliance-sensitive information

Department-level permissions require a custom user info endpoint that enriches authentication data (e.g., adding department information). This is more setup but gives you fine-grained control.

Choose your approach, then continue with the setup below. If you're doing simple SSO, you can skip the "Set up a user info endpoint" section.

### Configure your SSO/OAuth provider

You'll need credentials from your authentication provider. Gather:
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
- **Authorization endpoint** (where users log in)
- **Token endpoint** (where you exchange auth codes for tokens)
- **User info endpoint** (where you fetch user details)
- **Scopes** you're requesting (typically `openid profile email`)

If you're using a managed provider like Okta or Azure AD, their documentation will walk you through creating an "Application" or "App registration" to get these values.

For Mintlify, you'll configure these in your project settings. See the [authentication documentation](/auth/overview) for step-by-step setup.

### Set up a user info endpoint

Your SSO provider returns a user info endpoint that Mintlify calls after authentication succeeds. This endpoint should return the user's basic information in a standard format.

If you need to add custom logic—for example, determining which KB sections a user can see based on their department—you can set up a custom user info endpoint that calls your SSO provider and enriches the response with your own data.

This is where you'd handle department-level permissions. For example:
- User logs in through Okta
- Your endpoint fetches their profile from Okta
- Your endpoint checks an internal database for their department
- Your endpoint returns user info with a `department` claim
- Mintlify uses that claim to show/hide content

If all users get full access, you can skip this step and use the provider's default user info endpoint.

### Handle CORS for cross-domain scenarios

If your KB is hosted at `kb.company.com` and your SSO provider is at `auth.company.com`, CORS headers need to be configured to allow requests between them.

Most managed SSO providers handle this automatically for registered redirect URIs. When you configure your application in your SSO provider, make sure to register your Mintlify domain as an allowed redirect URI.

### Test your authentication flow

Before launching publicly:
1. Log out completely
2. Try accessing your KB from an incognito window
3. Verify you're redirected to your SSO login
4. Verify you're redirected back after login
5. Check that user info (name, email) is displayed correctly in your profile

If you set up a custom user info endpoint, verify that custom claims are being populated correctly.

## Optimizing search for knowledge discovery

Search is how most of your users will find content. Investing in search quality pays dividends.

### Enable AI search features

Mintlify's AI search understands natural language, so users don't need to match exact keywords. For example, a user can search "how do I add a team member" and find your onboarding guide, even if that guide is titled "New hire checklist."

Enable AI search in your project settings. It works best when your content is well-written and uses natural language—avoid overly technical jargon or acronyms without explanation.

The AI search also learns from user behavior. As people search and click results, the system improves its understanding of what content is relevant to each query.

### Configure search filters

Allow users to narrow results by meaningful dimensions:
- **Department**: If your KB is organized by department (Finance, HR, Engineering)
- **Content type**: Policies, Processes, FAQs, Guides
- **Date**: "Show me updates from the last 30 days"
- **Audience**: "Content for new employees" vs "Content for managers"

You configure filters in your docs.json file by adding metadata to pages. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "path": "finance/budgeting",
      "metadata": {
        "department": "finance",
        "contentType": "process",
        "audience": "managers"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Start with 1-2 filters and add more based on user feedback. Too many filters make search harder, not easier.

### Set up search analytics

Track what people search for. Mintlify provides analytics showing:
- Most common search queries
- Queries that return no results (content gaps)
- Queries that get clicks (useful results)
- Queries that don't get clicks (irrelevant results)

Review these monthly. Look for:
- **No results queries**: Create new content or update existing pages to include these terms
- **Zero-click queries**: Results aren't matching intent—revise titles and descriptions
- **High-click queries**: These articles are valuable—keep them updated and prominent

### Handle multiple content formats

If you have PDFs, videos, or other media, decide how they fit into your KB:
- **Embed videos** in relevant articles (users see them without leaving your KB)
- **Link to PDFs** if they're large or need to be downloaded
- **Transcribe videos** so their content is searchable
- **Convert PDFs to markdown** when possible (they're more accessible and searchable than PDFs)

For PDFs you can't convert, make sure they're titled clearly and indexed by your search engine. Add a brief text summary above the download link explaining what the PDF contains—this helps users know whether it's relevant before downloading.
## Integrate with existing tools

Your KB shouldn't exist in isolation. Meet users where they already work.

### Slack integration

Set up a Slack app that lets users query your KB without leaving Slack. Users type `/kb how do I submit an expense report` and get results in Slack.

When users request this in Slack, your app calls the Mintlify search API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.mintlify.com/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"expense report","limit":5}'
```

The response returns search results that your Slack app formats and posts back to the user.

### Link from your internal dashboard

Add a prominent link to your KB in places employees already look for information:
- Your employee intranet or internal website
- Okta, Microsoft 365, or other identity/dashboard platforms
- Slack workspace bookmarks
- Confluence or other internal wiki pages

### Embed KB search in support tools

If your team uses Zendesk, Jira Service Desk, or similar tools, embed KB search there. Support agents can find relevant articles to share with customers without leaving their support platform.

### Set up API access for custom integrations

Mintlify's API lets you query your KB programmatically. Common use cases:

- **Chatbots**: Pull answers from your KB to answer questions
- **Internal tools**: Surface KB content in context where employees work
- **Automated workflows**: Check KB content in background jobs

Example: Query the search API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.mintlify.com/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "vacation policy",
    "filters": {"department": "hr"},
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

See the [API documentation](/api/search) for complete integration details.


## Establish maintenance workflows

A knowledge base can decay quickly without maintenance. Set up systems to keep content up to date and help your team contribute to the knowledge base.

### Assign content ownership

Designate an owner or small team for each section of your KB. They don't write all the content, but they're responsible for:
- Reviewing content regularly
- Flagging outdated information
- Approving new articles in their domain
- Responding when users report errors

Make ownership clear in your KB (add an "Maintained by" line in each section) so people know who to contact.

### Set up review cycles and content verification

Content becomes stale. Establish a review schedule:
- **Critical content** (security, compliance, policies): Review every 30 days
- **Standard content** (processes, guides): Review every 90 days
- **Evergreen content** (background info): Review yearly

When reviewing, check:
- Are links still valid?
- Have systems or processes changed?
- Are examples current?
- Is there new information that should be added?

Track reviews in a spreadsheet or issue tracker so you can see what's been checked and what's coming due.

### Create contribution guidelines

Make it easy for anyone to improve the knowledge base. Your guidelines should cover:

- **Format**: What file format, heading structure, and style do you use?
- **Process**: Do they submit a pull request? Email a draft? Use a form?
- **Review**: Who reviews submissions? What's the turnaround time?
- **Scope**: What types of content are in scope? (e.g., "procedure guides, not personal blog posts")

Share these guidelines prominently so new contributors understand the process.

### Monitor usage metrics

Review how your team uses the knowledge base to prioritize content and identify areas for improvement. Set a regular cadence for reviewing usage metrics—monthly or quarterly are good intervals.

- Which articles get the most views? Invest in keeping these accurate and easy to read.
- Which articles get no views? Consider removing them or improving discoverability.
- What's the bounce rate? If people leave immediately, the content might not be helpful or navigation could be improved.

## Conclusion

Your knowledge base is now live. You've set up:
- A clear navigation structure that matches how your team thinks about content
- Authentication so only the right people have access
- Search optimization so users can find what they need
- Integration with tools your team already uses
- A maintenance process to keep content current

The KB is ready to go, but the real work starts with adoption. Make sure people know it exists, and encourage them to contribute improvements as they discover gaps or outdated information.
