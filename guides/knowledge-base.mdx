## Introduction

This guide shows you how to create an internal knowledge base on Mintlify. You'll set up a navigation structure, migrate or create content, configure authentication, and establish a maintenance process.

This guide assumes you are migrating content from an existing knowledge base to Mintlify. If you are creating a knowledge base with entirely new content, you can follow similar steps. Skip the audit and migration steps.

### Prerequisites

- An authentication system (SSO or OAuth provider like Okta or Azure AD)
- Control over your domain for hosting
- Admin access to your Mintlify organization

## Audit existing content

Document what content you have to understand the scope of migration and plan your new KB structure.

- **Total number of articles**: Helps estimate migration effort and track completeness
- **Topics and content**: What does each article cover? This informs your navigation structure
- **Current organization**: How is content currently structured? Does it work or should you reorganize?
- **Content types**: What formats do you have (text, PDFs, videos, embedded content)?
- **Metadata**: Are there dates, authors, tags, or other metadata worth preserving?
- **Access requirements**: Who needs access to each article? This determines your authentication approach

## Identify your access requirements

Determine who needs access to your knowledge base and whether content should be restricted.

**Simple access**: All authenticated employees see the entire knowledge base.
- Everyone on your team can access all articles
- Fastest and simplest setup
- Good if your KB isn't sensitive or you only host it on your internal network

**Restricted access**: Different employees see different content based on department or role.
- Finance articles only visible to Finance team
- HR content only visible to HR team
- Good for sensitive information (financial data, legal docs, etc.)
- Requires additional authentication configuration

## Export your existing content

Most knowledge base platforms support exporting content in standard formats. The format you choose depends on your current platform and your priorities.

- Export to **Markdown** for the simplest migration to Mintlify. This is the recommended format for migrating your content to Mintlify.
- Export to **HTML** if Markdown isn't available. You must convert your content to Markdown later.
- Export to **JSON or CSV** if you have structured metadata to preserve.

## Design the navigation structure

Your navigation structure determines how people find content in your KB. You can recreate your existing structure or redesign it to better match how your team thinks about the content.

<Tip>
  Migrating is a good time to improve your structure. Consider whether your current organization actually works for your team, or if you can reorganize to make information easier to find.
</Tip>

Your `docs.json` file defines how your knowledge base is organized. Create this file at the root of your project repository.

```json
{
  "name": "Company Knowledge Base",
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Finance",
      "pages": [
        "finance/overview",
        "finance/budgeting-process",
        "finance/expense-reports",
        "finance/cost-allocation"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "HR",
      "pages": [
        "hr/overview",
        "hr/onboarding",
        "hr/benefits",
        "hr/time-off-policy"
      ]
    },
    {
      "group": "Engineering",
      "pages": [
        "engineering/overview",
        "engineering/dev-setup",
        "engineering/deployment",
        "engineering/code-standards"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Navigation strategy

Start with a clear, organized sidebar structure that users can browse. A good navigation structure helps new employees explore and understand company processes. Once users are familiar with your KB, they'll often use search instead of browsing.

You can optimize search with filters later (by department, content type, etc.) to help experienced users find answers faster.

## Set up authentication for internal access

Mintlify supports authentication through OpenID Connect (OIDC), which works with most enterprise SSO providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Auth0, and others).

### Plan your authentication approach

First, decide who needs access and what level of permissions they need:

**Simple SSO**: All authenticated employees get full access to your entire KB. Use this if:
- Your KB isn't sensitive (or is only accessible internally anyway)
- You don't need department-specific content restrictions
- You want the fastest setup

With simple SSO, anyone logged into your domain can see everything. This is the easiest option.

**Department-level permissions**: Different employees see different KB sections based on their department or role. Use this if:
- Finance articles should only be visible to Finance employees
- You have sensitive content that needs restricted access
- You're handling compliance-sensitive information

Department-level permissions require a custom user info endpoint that enriches authentication data (e.g., adding department information). This is more setup but gives you fine-grained control.

Choose your approach, then continue with the setup below. If you're doing simple SSO, you can skip the "Set up a user info endpoint" section.

### Configure your SSO/OAuth provider

You'll need credentials from your authentication provider. Gather:
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
- **Authorization endpoint** (where users log in)
- **Token endpoint** (where you exchange auth codes for tokens)
- **User info endpoint** (where you fetch user details)
- **Scopes** you're requesting (typically `openid profile email`)

If you're using a managed provider like Okta or Azure AD, their documentation will walk you through creating an "Application" or "App registration" to get these values.

For Mintlify, you'll configure these in your project settings. See the [authentication documentation](/auth/overview) for step-by-step setup.

### Set up a user info endpoint

Your SSO provider returns a user info endpoint that Mintlify calls after authentication succeeds. This endpoint should return the user's basic information in a standard format.

If you need to add custom logic—for example, determining which KB sections a user can see based on their department—you can set up a custom user info endpoint that calls your SSO provider and enriches the response with your own data.

This is where you'd handle department-level permissions. For example:
- User logs in through Okta
- Your endpoint fetches their profile from Okta
- Your endpoint checks an internal database for their department
- Your endpoint returns user info with a `department` claim
- Mintlify uses that claim to show/hide content

If all users get full access, you can skip this step and use the provider's default user info endpoint.

### Handle CORS for cross-domain scenarios

If your KB is hosted at `kb.company.com` and your SSO provider is at `auth.company.com`, CORS headers need to be configured to allow requests between them.

Most managed SSO providers handle this automatically for registered redirect URIs. When you configure your application in your SSO provider, make sure to register your Mintlify domain as an allowed redirect URI.

### Test your authentication flow

Before launching publicly:
1. Log out completely
2. Try accessing your KB from an incognito window
3. Verify you're redirected to your SSO login
4. Verify you're redirected back after login
5. Check that user info (name, email) is displayed correctly in your profile

If you set up a custom user info endpoint, verify that custom claims are being populated correctly.

## Migrate your content

Move your exported content into the folder structure you designed. Convert content to Markdown if needed, add frontmatter, and set up internal links.

### Organize files by your navigation structure

Create folders that match your `docs.json` structure. For example, if your `docs.json` has a Finance group, create a `finance/` folder:

```
your-kb/
├── docs.json
├── finance/
│   ├── overview.mdx
│   ├── budgeting-process.mdx
│   ├── expense-reports.mdx
│   └── cost-allocation.mdx
├── hr/
│   ├── overview.mdx
│   ├── onboarding.mdx
│   ├── benefits.mdx
│   └── time-off-policy.mdx
└── engineering/
    ├── overview.mdx
    ├── dev-setup.mdx
    ├── deployment.mdx
    └── code-standards.mdx
```

Place each article in its corresponding folder. The file path must match the path in your `docs.json`. For example, if `docs.json` references `"finance/expense-reports"`, the file should be `finance/expense-reports.mdx`.

### Add frontmatter to each article

Every `.mdx` file needs frontmatter at the top with metadata. Here's a complete example:

```mdx
---
title: "Expense Report Process"
sidebarTitle: "Expense Reports"
description: "How to submit and track expense reports within 30 days"
---

## Overview

All employees must submit expense reports within 30 days of the expense date.

## Submission steps

1. Log into the expense system with your company credentials
2. Create a new report for the appropriate month
3. Add receipts and descriptions for each expense
4. Categorize expenses by type (meals, travel, supplies, etc.)
5. Submit for your manager's approval
6. Finance reviews within 5 business days

## Common questions

**Can I submit expenses after 30 days?** Contact Finance at finance@company.com for exceptions.

**What receipts do I need?** Original itemized receipts for all expenses over $25.
```

**Frontmatter fields:**
- **title**: What appears as the article heading in your KB
- **sidebarTitle** (optional): Shorter name for the navigation sidebar
- **description**: Brief summary that appears in search results

### Set up internal links

Link between articles using relative paths. To link from one article to another:

```mdx
See [Onboarding Guide](../hr/onboarding) for new employee setup.

For questions, contact [HR Benefits Team](../hr/benefits#common-questions).
```

The link path is relative to the current file. `../` goes up one folder level. This lets readers navigate between related articles.

### Convert HTML and other formats to Markdown

If you exported your content as HTML, convert it to Markdown. Many tools can help:
- **Pandoc**: Command-line tool that converts between many formats
- **CloudConvert**: Online converter supporting HTML, DOCX, PDF, and more
- **VS Code extensions**: Search for "HTML to Markdown" in extensions

The goal is to end up with `.mdx` files that have proper Markdown formatting and frontmatter.

### Handle multiple content formats

If you have PDFs, videos, or other media, decide how they fit:
- **Embed videos**: Add them inline in relevant articles so users see them without leaving your KB
- **Link to PDFs**: For large files that need downloading, add a link with a brief description
- **Transcribe videos**: Add transcripts so search can index the content
- **Convert PDFs to Markdown**: When possible, convert PDFs to Markdown for better searchability and accessibility

For PDFs you can't convert, title them clearly and add a brief summary above the link explaining what the PDF contains.

## Test your knowledge base locally

Before deploying, test your KB locally to catch issues with structure, links, and formatting.

### Start the local development server

Install the Mintlify CLI and run the development server:

```bash
npm install -g mintlify
cd your-kb
mintlify dev
```

This starts a local server (usually at `http://localhost:3000`) where you can preview your KB.

### Check these things

**Navigation structure**:
- Does the sidebar show all your sections and articles?
- Are sections in the right order?
- Are article titles clear and helpful?

**Links and routing**:
- Do internal links work? (Click on links between articles)
- Does clicking on sidebar items navigate correctly?
- Check for broken links in your content

**Content formatting**:
- Does your Markdown render correctly?
- Are headings, lists, and code blocks formatted properly?
- Do embedded images and videos display?

**Frontmatter**:
- Do article titles appear correctly?
- Do descriptions show up in search results?
- Are sidebar titles shorter than main titles?

**Mobile experience**:
- Does the KB work on mobile devices?
- Is navigation accessible on smaller screens?
- Check that embedded content is responsive

### Fix issues and iterate

If you find problems:
1. Edit the file in your editor
2. Save the file
3. The local dev server automatically reloads
4. Check the result in your browser

Make sure everything works before proceeding to authentication setup.

## Configure AI assistant

The [assistant](/ai/assistant) is automatically enabled for Pro and Custom plans. You can customize the assistant from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings).

- **Search sites**: Select additional sites other than your knowledge base that the assistant can search when responding to questions.
- **Set sample questions**: Set default questions that appear when someone opens the assistant panel. If people have frequent questions like "how do I submit an expense report" or "what is the company's vacation policy", add them here to save people time.

## Integrate with existing tools

Your KB shouldn't exist in isolation. Meet users where they already work.

### Slack integration

Set up a Slack app so employees can query your KB without leaving Slack. Users type `/kb how do I submit an expense report` and get results in Slack.

See the [Slack integration guide](/ai/slack-app) for setup instructions.

### Link from your internal dashboard

Add a prominent link to your KB in places employees already look for information:
- Your employee intranet or internal website
- Okta, Microsoft 365, or other identity/dashboard platforms
- Slack workspace bookmarks
- Confluence or other internal wiki pages

### Embed KB search in support tools

If your team uses Zendesk, Jira Service Desk, or similar tools, embed knowledge base search there. Support agents can find relevant articles to share with customers without leaving their support platform.

## Establish maintenance workflows

A knowledge base can decay quickly without maintenance. Set up systems to keep content up to date and help your team contribute to the knowledge base.

### Assign content ownership

Designate an owner or small team for each section of your KB. They don't write all the content, but they're responsible for:
- Reviewing content regularly
- Flagging outdated information
- Approving new articles in their domain
- Responding when users report errors

Make ownership clear in your KB (add an "Maintained by" line in each section) so people know who to contact.

### Set up review cycles and content verification

Content becomes stale. Establish a review schedule:
- **Critical content** (security, compliance, policies): Review every 30 days
- **Standard content** (processes, guides): Review every 90 days
- **Evergreen content** (background info): Review yearly

When reviewing, check:
- Are links still valid?
- Have systems or processes changed?
- Are examples current?
- Is there new information that should be added?

Track reviews in a spreadsheet or issue tracker so you can see what's been checked and what's coming due.

### Create contribution guidelines

Make it easy for anyone to improve the knowledge base. Your guidelines should cover:

- **Format**: What file format, heading structure, and style do you use?
- **Process**: Do they submit a pull request? Email a draft? Use a form?
- **Review**: Who reviews submissions? What's the turnaround time?
- **Scope**: What types of content are in scope? (e.g., "procedure guides, not personal blog posts")

Share these guidelines prominently so new contributors understand the process.

### Monitor usage metrics

Review how your team uses the knowledge base to prioritize content and identify areas for improvement. Set a regular cadence for reviewing usage metrics—monthly or quarterly are good intervals.

- Which articles get the most views? Invest in keeping these accurate and easy to read.
- Which articles get no views? Consider removing them or improving discoverability.
- What's the bounce rate? If people leave immediately, the content might not be helpful or navigation could be improved.

## Conclusion

Your knowledge base is now live. You've set up:
- A clear navigation structure that matches how your team thinks about content
- Authentication so only the right people have access
- Search optimization so users can find what they need
- Integration with tools your team already uses
- A maintenance process to keep content current

The KB is ready to go, but the real work starts with adoption. Make sure people know it exists, and encourage them to contribute improvements as they discover gaps or outdated information.
