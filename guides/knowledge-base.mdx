## Introduction

This guide shows you how to create an internal knowledge base on Mintlify. You'll set up a navigation structure, migrate or create content, configure authentication, and establish a maintenance process.

This guide assumes you are migrating content from an existing knowledge base to Mintlify. If you are creating a knowledge base with entirely new content, you can follow similar steps. Skip the audit and migration steps.

### Prerequisites

- An authentication system (SSO or OAuth provider like Okta or Azure AD)
- Control over your domain for hosting
- Admin access to your Mintlify organization

## Audit existing content

Catalog the content you currently have in your existing knowledge base. This helps you understand what content you need to migrate, plan how to organize it in your new knowledge base, identify any gaps in your content, and confirm that you moved all of your content to your new knowledge base.

- Total number of pages: Help estimate migration time and keep track of content completeness.
- Topics of each page: Informs your navigation structure and content organization.
- Current navigation structure: See how your content is currently organized and whether it matches your desired structure.
- Content types: Determine any content conversion requirements for text, PDFs, videos, and embedded content
- Metadata: Identify any metadata that needs to be preserved like dates, authors, and tags.
- Who needs access to each page: Determine the best authentication approach for your knowledge base.

## Identify your access requirements

Determine the authentication requirements for your knowledge base. If everyone on your team should have access to the entire knowledge base, set up simple access. If you need to restrict access to certain users or groups, set up personalized access.

**Simple access**: All authenticated users see the entire knowledge base.
- Use this if everyone should have access to the entire knowledge base.
- Fastest to set up.

**Personalized access**: Different users see different content based on team or role.
- Use this if you have sensitive or restricted content that should only be visible to certain users or groups like financial or legal data.
- Use this to personalize the knowledge base for different users or groups.
- Requires a custom authentication setup.

## Export your existing content

Most knowledge base platforms support exporting content in standard formats. The format you choose depends on your current platform and your priorities.

- Export to **Markdown** for the simplest migration to Mintlify. This is the recommended format for migrating your content to Mintlify.
- Export to **HTML** if Markdown isn't available. You must convert your content to Markdown later.
- Export to **JSON or CSV** if you have structured metadata to preserve.

## Design the navigation structure for your knowledge base

Your knowledge base's navigation structure affects how people find content. Either recreate your existing navigation structure or design a new organization pattern that makes sense for your team. Create a `docs.json` file that defines your knowledge base's navigation structure.

<Tip>
  Migrating content is an opportunity to redesign your navigation structure. Take time to determine how your knowledge base can be improved now to help your team find information more easily in the future.
</Tip>

Your `docs.json` file defines how your knowledge base is organized. Create this file at the root of your project repository.

```json Example docs.json file
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Finance",
        "pages": [
            "finance/overview",
            "finance/budgeting-process",
            "finance/expense-reports",
            "finance/cost-allocation"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "HR",
        "pages": [
            "hr/overview",
            "hr/onboarding",
            "hr/benefits",
            "hr/time-off-policy"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Engineering",
        "pages": [
          "engineering/overview",
          "engineering/dev-setup",
          "engineering/deployment",
          "engineering/code-standards"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Start with browse-first navigation

Begin with a clear, organized structure that users can browse. We'll optimize for search later. New employees especially benefit from being able to explore your KB's structure to understand how the company works.

Later, you can add search filters by department, content type, or other metadata to handle search-first users who know what they're looking for.

## Set up authentication for internal access

Mintlify supports authentication through OpenID Connect (OIDC), which works with most enterprise SSO providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Auth0, and others).

### Plan your authentication approach

First, decide who needs access and what level of permissions they need:

**Simple SSO**: All authenticated employees get full access to your entire KB. Use this if:
- Your KB isn't sensitive (or is only accessible internally anyway)
- You don't need department-specific content restrictions
- You want the fastest setup

With simple SSO, anyone logged into your domain can see everything. This is the easiest option.

**Department-level permissions**: Different employees see different KB sections based on their department or role. Use this if:
- Finance articles should only be visible to Finance employees
- You have sensitive content that needs restricted access
- You're handling compliance-sensitive information

Department-level permissions require a custom user info endpoint that enriches authentication data (e.g., adding department information). This is more setup but gives you fine-grained control.

Choose your approach, then continue with the setup below. If you're doing simple SSO, you can skip the "Set up a user info endpoint" section.

### Configure your SSO/OAuth provider

You'll need credentials from your authentication provider. Gather:
- **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
- **Authorization endpoint** (where users log in)
- **Token endpoint** (where you exchange auth codes for tokens)
- **User info endpoint** (where you fetch user details)
- **Scopes** you're requesting (typically `openid profile email`)

If you're using a managed provider like Okta or Azure AD, their documentation will walk you through creating an "Application" or "App registration" to get these values.

For Mintlify, you'll configure these in your project settings. See the [authentication documentation](/auth/overview) for step-by-step setup.

### Set up a user info endpoint

Your SSO provider returns a user info endpoint that Mintlify calls after authentication succeeds. This endpoint should return the user's basic information in a standard format.

If you need to add custom logic—for example, determining which KB sections a user can see based on their department—you can set up a custom user info endpoint that calls your SSO provider and enriches the response with your own data.

This is where you'd handle department-level permissions. For example:
- User logs in through Okta
- Your endpoint fetches their profile from Okta
- Your endpoint checks an internal database for their department
- Your endpoint returns user info with a `department` claim
- Mintlify uses that claim to show/hide content

If all users get full access, you can skip this step and use the provider's default user info endpoint.

### Handle CORS for cross-domain scenarios

If your KB is hosted at `kb.company.com` and your SSO provider is at `auth.company.com`, CORS headers need to be configured to allow requests between them.

Most managed SSO providers handle this automatically for registered redirect URIs. When you configure your application in your SSO provider, make sure to register your Mintlify domain as an allowed redirect URI.

### Test your authentication flow

Before launching publicly:
1. Log out completely
2. Try accessing your KB from an incognito window
3. Verify you're redirected to your SSO login
4. Verify you're redirected back after login
5. Check that user info (name, email) is displayed correctly in your profile

If you set up a custom user info endpoint, verify that custom claims are being populated correctly.

## Add content to your knowledge base

Move existing content into the appropriate folders in your project repository. Create any new files as needed. Add required metadata for authentication.

### Handle multiple content formats

If you have PDFs, videos, or other media, decide how they fit into your KB:
- **Embed videos** in relevant articles (users see them without leaving your KB)
- **Link to PDFs** if they're large or need to be downloaded
- **Transcribe videos** so their content is searchable
- **Convert PDFs to markdown** when possible (they're more accessible and searchable than PDFs)

For PDFs you can't convert, make sure they're titled clearly and indexed by your search engine. Add a brief text summary above the download link explaining what the PDF contains—this helps users know whether it's relevant before downloading.

## Enable AI features

Mintlify's AI search understands natural language, so users don't need to match exact keywords. For example, a user can search "how do I add a team member" and find your onboarding guide, even if that guide is titled "New hire checklist."

Enable AI search in your project settings. It works best when your content is well-written and uses natural language—avoid overly technical jargon or acronyms without explanation.

The AI search also learns from user behavior. As people search and click results, the system improves its understanding of what content is relevant to each query.

## Integrate with existing tools

Your KB shouldn't exist in isolation. Meet users where they already work.

### Slack integration

### Link from your internal dashboard

Add a prominent link to your KB in places employees already look for information:
- Your employee intranet or internal website
- Okta, Microsoft 365, or other identity/dashboard platforms
- Slack workspace bookmarks
- Confluence or other internal wiki pages

### Embed KB search in support tools

If your team uses Zendesk, Jira Service Desk, or similar tools, embed knowledge base search there. Support agents can find relevant articles to share with customers without leaving their support platform.

## Establish maintenance workflows

A knowledge base can decay quickly without maintenance. Set up systems to keep content up to date and help your team contribute to the knowledge base.

### Assign content ownership

Designate an owner or small team for each section of your KB. They don't write all the content, but they're responsible for:
- Reviewing content regularly
- Flagging outdated information
- Approving new articles in their domain
- Responding when users report errors

Make ownership clear in your KB (add an "Maintained by" line in each section) so people know who to contact.

### Set up review cycles and content verification

Content becomes stale. Establish a review schedule:
- **Critical content** (security, compliance, policies): Review every 30 days
- **Standard content** (processes, guides): Review every 90 days
- **Evergreen content** (background info): Review yearly

When reviewing, check:
- Are links still valid?
- Have systems or processes changed?
- Are examples current?
- Is there new information that should be added?

Track reviews in a spreadsheet or issue tracker so you can see what's been checked and what's coming due.

### Create contribution guidelines

Make it easy for anyone to improve the knowledge base. Your guidelines should cover:

- **Format**: What file format, heading structure, and style do you use?
- **Process**: Do they submit a pull request? Email a draft? Use a form?
- **Review**: Who reviews submissions? What's the turnaround time?
- **Scope**: What types of content are in scope? (e.g., "procedure guides, not personal blog posts")

Share these guidelines prominently so new contributors understand the process.

### Monitor usage metrics

Review how your team uses the knowledge base to prioritize content and identify areas for improvement. Set a regular cadence for reviewing usage metrics—monthly or quarterly are good intervals.

- Which articles get the most views? Invest in keeping these accurate and easy to read.
- Which articles get no views? Consider removing them or improving discoverability.
- What's the bounce rate? If people leave immediately, the content might not be helpful or navigation could be improved.

## Conclusion

Your knowledge base is now live. You've set up:
- A clear navigation structure that matches how your team thinks about content
- Authentication so only the right people have access
- Search optimization so users can find what they need
- Integration with tools your team already uses
- A maintenance process to keep content current

The KB is ready to go, but the real work starts with adoption. Make sure people know it exists, and encourage them to contribute improvements as they discover gaps or outdated information.
