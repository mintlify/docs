The analytics page provides insights into how your documentation is performing, helping you identify improvement opportunities and track changes over time.

## Accessing analytics

Navigate to the **Analytics** tab in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/analytics).

Use the range selector to adjust the time period for displayed data.

## Analytics tabs

The analytics dashboard has three main sections:

### Overview
View traffic and other high-level insights about your docs.

- **Visitors**: Unique visitors.
- **Views**: Total page views.
- **Actions**: Combined count of API calls, navbar link clicks, and CTA button clicks.
- **Popular Pages**: Most-visited pages with view counts.
- **Referrers**: Top traffic sources directing users to your docs.

### Feedback
Monitor user satisfaction through voting data:

- **Liked by viewers**: Pages with the most positive feedback (thumbs up votes).
- **Needs improvement**: Pages with the most negative feedback (thumbs down votes).

To view feedback data, you must first enable feedback from the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page in your dashboard.

### Search
Understand how users search within your documentation.

- **Total queries**: Search volume.
- **Top searches**: Most-searched terms.
- **Low-confidence searches**: Queries that may not have found relevant results.

## Improving your docs with analytics

Use your analytics to enhance the user experience of your docs:

**Review popular content**: Ensure your most-visited pages contain current, accurate information and consider expanding successful topics.

**Address feedback concerns**: Investigate pages with negative feedback to identify and resolve user pain points.

**Optimize for search**: Review top search queries so that relevant pages are discoverable and up-to-date. Pay attention to low-confidence searches that might indicate content gaps.
