Keep your CLI updated to access the latest features, bug fixes, and ensure your local preview matches your production documentation.

## Why update the CLI

The CLI is regularly updated with:

- **New features** - Access the latest components, configuration options, and commands
- **Bug fixes** - Resolve issues with local preview, broken link detection, and other utilities
- **Performance improvements** - Faster build times and more efficient local development
- **Compatibility** - Ensure your local preview matches what users see in production

## Check your current version

To see which version of the CLI you have installed, run:

```bash
mint --version
```

## Update the CLI

### Using the update command

The simplest way to update is using the built-in update command:

```bash
mint update
```

This command checks for the latest version and updates your installation automatically.

### Manual update

If the `mint update` command is not available on your version, manually reinstall the CLI with the latest version:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm i -g mint@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint@latest
```
</CodeGroup>

## When to update

Update your CLI when:

- Your local preview looks different from production
- You encounter errors or unexpected behavior
- You want to use new features mentioned in the [changelog](/changelog)
- You're starting work on documentation after a break

<Tip>
  Run `mint update` regularly to stay current with the latest improvements.

## Troubleshooting updates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Update command not found">
    If `mint update` doesn't work, your CLI version is too old to support this command. Manually reinstall using `npm i -g mint@latest` or `pnpm add -g mint@latest`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied during update">
    If you encounter permission errors, try running the command with `sudo`:

    ```bash
    sudo npm i -g mint@latest
    ```

    You'll be prompted for your password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update doesn't fix preview issues">
    If updating doesn't resolve preview discrepancies:

    1. Delete the `~/.mintlify` folder from the root of your device
    2. Run `mint dev` again to regenerate the cache
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
