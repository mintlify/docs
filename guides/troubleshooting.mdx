This guide covers common issues you may encounter when setting up and maintaining your Mintlify documentation site.

## Build and deployment issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build fails with 'docs.json not found'">
    Ensure your `docs.json` file is in the root of your documentation repository. The file name must be exactly `docs.json` (lowercase).

    ```
    your-docs-repo/
    ├── docs.json
    ├── index.mdx
    └── ...
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes not appearing after push">
    1. Check your deployment status in the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    2. Verify the GitHub App has access to your repository.
    3. Clear your browser cache or try incognito mode.
    4. Wait a few minutes—deployments can take up to 5 minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preview deployment not generating">
    Preview deployments require:
    - The GitHub App installed with access to your repository
    - A pull request (not just a branch push)
    - No build errors in your documentation

    Check the PR comments for deployment status or errors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build fails with validation errors">
    Run `mint dev` locally to see detailed error messages. Common causes:
    - Invalid JSON in `docs.json`
    - Missing required frontmatter fields
    - Broken internal links
    - Invalid MDX syntax
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Local development issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'mint' command not found">
    Install the CLI globally:

    ```bash
    npm i -g mint
    ```

    If you still get errors, ensure Node.js v20.17.0+ is installed and your PATH includes npm global binaries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local preview shows blank page">
    1. Check the terminal for error messages.
    2. Ensure you're running `mint dev` from the directory containing `docs.json`.
    3. Try clearing the `.mintlify` cache folder and restarting.
    4. Verify your `docs.json` is valid JSON.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hot reload not working">
    Hot reload may not work for:
    - Changes to `docs.json` (restart required)
    - New files (may need refresh)
    - Syntax errors in MDX files

    Try stopping and restarting `mint dev`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port 3000 already in use">
    Either stop the other process using port 3000, or specify a different port:

    ```bash
    mint dev --port 3001
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content and navigation issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Page not appearing in navigation">
    1. Verify the page is listed in `docs.json` navigation.
    2. Check the file path matches exactly (case-sensitive).
    3. Ensure the file has valid frontmatter with `title`.
    4. Check the file isn't excluded by `.mintignore`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Broken internal links">
    Internal links should:
    - Use relative paths without file extensions: `/guides/quickstart`
    - Match the exact path in your navigation
    - Not include the language prefix for same-language links

    Run `mint dev` to see broken link warnings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Images not displaying">
    1. Place images in a `/images` folder at your docs root.
    2. Reference with absolute paths: `/images/screenshot.png`
    3. Ensure file names don't contain spaces or special characters.
    4. Check the image file actually exists at that path.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code blocks not syntax highlighting">
    Add a language identifier after the opening backticks:

    ````mdx
    ```javascript
    const example = "highlighted";
    ```
    ````

    Supported languages include: javascript, typescript, python, bash, json, yaml, and many more.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Custom domain issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
    1. Verify DNS records are configured correctly:
       - CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
    2. Allow up to 48 hours for DNS propagation.
    3. Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your records.
    4. Ensure no conflicting A records exist.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL certificate errors">
    SSL certificates are automatically provisioned. If you see errors:
    1. Wait 24 hours after DNS configuration.
    2. Verify the domain is correctly configured in your dashboard.
    3. Contact support if issues persist after 48 hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redirect loops with custom domain">
    If using a reverse proxy or CDN:
    1. Ensure SSL/TLS is set to "Full" or "Full (Strict)".
    2. Disable any automatic HTTPS redirects on your proxy.
    3. Check for conflicting redirect rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Users can't access protected pages">
    1. Verify authentication is properly configured in your dashboard.
    2. Check that the user's session hasn't expired.
    3. Ensure the authentication provider is returning the correct claims.
    4. Test with a fresh browser session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OAuth callback errors">
    1. Verify the callback URL is correctly configured in your OAuth provider.
    2. Check that client ID and secret are correct.
    3. Ensure the OAuth provider allows the redirect URI.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pages loading slowly">
    1. Optimize images—use WebP format and compress large files.
    2. Reduce the number of external scripts.
    3. Check for large code blocks or embedded content.
    4. Use the browser's Network tab to identify slow resources.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Search not returning expected results">
    1. Ensure pages have descriptive titles and content.
    2. Check that pages aren't marked with `noindex`.
    3. Wait for the search index to update after changes (up to 24 hours).
    4. Verify the page isn't excluded by `.mintignore`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
