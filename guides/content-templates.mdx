Use these templates as starting points for creating documentation. Customize the templates for your documentation and your audience.

1. Copy the template that matches your content type.
2. Replace placeholders and example content with your actual content.
3. Adjust sections as needed.
4. Remove any sections that don't apply.

<Tip>
  Not sure which template to use? Read about [content types](/guides/content-types) to understand when to use each one.

## How-to guide template

Use how-to guides when users need to accomplish a specific task and already have some familiarity with your product. How-tos are goal-driven and get straight to the solution.

````mdx How-to guide template
---
title: "[Titles should start with a verb]"
description: "[Do specific task] to [achieve outcome]."
---

Start with a brief statement of what this guide helps users accomplish.

## Prerequisites (optional)

List only what's necessary:

- Required setup or configuration
- Permissions needed
- Related features that should be configured first

## [Action-oriented heading describing the task]

Provide direct instructions focused on achieving the goal.

1. Open [location] and navigate to [specific place]
2. Click [button or option]
3. Enter [required information]
4. Click [confirmation button]

```language
// Include code examples that users can copy and modify
```

<Tip>
  Include practical tips that help users avoid common mistakes or work more efficiently.
</Tip>

## Verify the result (optional)

If success is ambiguous, explain how users can confirm they completed the task successfully.

## Troubleshooting (optional)

Address common issues users might encounter:

- **Problem description**: Solution or workaround
- **Another common issue**: How to resolve it

## Related tasks

Link to related how-to guides or next steps.

## Tutorial template

Use tutorials when you want to help new users learn through hands-on practice. Tutorials guide users step-by-step through a complete learning experience with a clear outcome.

````mdx Tutorial template
---
title: "[Action verb] [specific outcome]"
description: "Learn how to [specific outcome] by [method or approach]."
---

Use an introduction paragraph to explain what users will learn and what they'll be able to do after completing this tutorial.

## Prerequisites

List what users need before starting:

- Required knowledge or skills
- Tools, accounts, or permissions
- Time commitment (optional)

## Step 1: [First action]

Provide clear, specific instructions for the first step.

```language
// Include code examples where helpful
```

Explain what this step accomplishes and why it matters.

## Step 2: [Second action]

Continue with sequential steps that build on previous work.

Point out milestones and progress markers so users know they're on track.

## Step 3: [Third action]

Keep steps focused on concrete actions rather than theory.

Minimize choices that users need to make.

## Next steps

Summarize what users learned and suggest logical next steps:

- Related tutorials to try
- How-to guides for common tasks
- Additional resources for deeper learning
````

## Explanation template

Use explanations when users need to understand concepts, design decisions, or how complex features work. Explanations provide context and deepen understanding rather than giving step-by-step instructions.

````mdx Explanation template
---
title: "About [concept or feature]"
description: "Understand [concept] and how it works within [product or context]."
---

Start with a clear statement of what this explanation covers and why understanding it matters.

Define the concept in plain language. Explain what it is, what it does, and why it exists.

Use analogies or comparisons to familiar concepts when helpful.

## How [concept] works

Explain the underlying mechanics, architecture, or process.

<Frame>
  <img src="/path/to/diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing how [concept] works" />
</Frame>

Break down complex ideas into digestible sections.

## Why [design decision or approach]

Provide context about why things work the way they do.

Discuss trade-offs, alternatives that were considered, or constraints that influenced the design.

## When to use [concept]

Help users understand when this concept or approach is most appropriate.

- **Use case 1**: When this approach makes sense
- **Use case 2**: Another scenario where this is the right choice
- **Not recommended for**: Situations where alternatives are better

## Relationship to other features

Draw connections to related concepts or features in your product.

Explain how this concept fits into the broader system or workflow.

## Common misconceptions

Address misunderstandings or clarify subtle distinctions.

## Further reading

Link to related explanations, tutorials, or reference documentation.

## Reference template

Use reference documentation when users need to look up specific details about your product's functionality. Reference docs prioritize accuracy, consistency, and scannability.

````mdx Reference template
