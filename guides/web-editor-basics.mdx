The web editor lets you create and edit your documentation directly in your browser—no coding experience required. Think of it like using Google Docs, but for your documentation site.

## Getting to the editor

1. Go to your [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Click **Editor** in the left sidebar

You'll see your documentation files listed on the left and an editing area on the right.

## Understanding the interface

The editor has three main areas:

- **File list (left side)**: Shows all your documentation pages
- **Editing area (center)**: Where you write and edit content
- **Toolbar (top)**: Buttons for formatting and publishing

    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img

    alt="Web editor interface showing file list, editing area, and toolbar"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

## Opening and editing a page

To edit an existing page:

1. Find the page in the file list on the left
2. Click on it to open
3. Click anywhere in the editing area to start typing

Your changes appear as you type, showing you exactly how they'll look on your live site.

## Adding formatting

You can format your text using the toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts:

- **Bold text**: Highlight text and click the **B** button
- **Italic text**: Highlight text and click the **I** button
- **Headings**: Click where you want a heading and select a heading size from the toolbar

<Tip>
  Press <kbd>/</kbd> (forward slash) to open a menu with all available formatting options and components.
</Tip>

## Adding special elements

The editor includes pre-built elements to make your documentation more helpful:

### Callout boxes

Callout boxes highlight important information. To add one:

1. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to open the component menu
2. Type "callout" or scroll to find it
3. Click the callout type you want (Tip, Warning, Info, etc.)
4. Type your message inside

### Code blocks

To add a code example:

1. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to open the component menu
2. Type "code" and select **Code Block**
3. Choose the programming language
4. Paste or type your code

### Images

To add an image:

1. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to open the component menu
2. Type "image" and select **Image**
3. Upload your image file or paste a URL

## Creating a new page

To create a new documentation page:

1. Click the **+** icon at the top of the file list
2. Type a name for your file (spaces are okay—they'll be converted automatically)
3. Press Enter
4. Start writing your content

<Note>
  After creating a new page, you'll need to add it to your navigation menu so visitors can find it. See the [Navigation guide](/organize/navigation) for help.
</Note>

## Saving your work

The editor automatically saves your work as you type. You'll see a "Saved" indicator in the toolbar when your changes are saved.

## Publishing your changes

When you're ready to make your changes live:

1. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner
2. Add a brief description of what you changed (optional but helpful)
3. Click **Publish** again to confirm

Your changes will appear on your live documentation site within a few minutes.

<Tip>
  If you're not sure about your changes, you can create a "branch" to preview them before publishing. Ask your team administrator about using branches for safer editing.
</Tip>

## Switching between visual and code view

The editor has two viewing modes:

- **Visual mode** (default): Shows your content as it will appear on your site
- **Markdown mode**: Shows the underlying code

Most non-technical users will want to stay in visual mode. However, if you need to copy content from another source or make precise adjustments, you can switch to Markdown mode using the toggle buttons in the toolbar.

## Finding pages quickly

If you have many documentation pages, use the search feature:

- Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Windows)
- Start typing the page name
- Click the page you want to open

## Common tasks

### Copying content from another page

1. Open the page you want to copy from
2. Select the content you want (click and drag)
3. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (Windows)
4. Open the destination page
5. Click where you want to paste
6. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> (Windows)

### Adding a link

1. Highlight the text you want to turn into a link
2. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (Windows)

4. Press Enter

### Undoing a mistake
