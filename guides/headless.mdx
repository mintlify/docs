Mintlify's headless solution lets you build fully custom documentation experiences while using our content management, search, and AI infrastructure. You control the frontend presentation layer while Mintlify handles content processing, search indexing, and AI-powered features.

This approach is ideal when you need complete control over your documentation's design, behavior, or integration with existing systems.

## What is headless documentation?

Headless documentation separates content management from presentation. You write and manage your documentation content in MDX files with Mintlify's tooling, but render it with your own custom frontend instead of using Mintlify's hosted interface.

With Mintlify's headless solution, you get:

- **Full design control**: Build any UI you want with your preferred framework
- **Content infrastructure**: Use Mintlify's MDX processing, component library, and content management
- **AI features**: Access search, assistant, and other AI-powered capabilities via API
- **Flexible deployment**: Host your documentation anywhere you choose

## Use cases

Consider a headless approach when you need to:

- Match an existing design system or brand guidelines exactly
- Embed documentation into a larger application or website
- Implement custom navigation patterns or user flows
- Integrate documentation with proprietary authentication or access control
- Support unique content layouts or interactive experiences
- Deploy to specific infrastructure or hosting requirements

## Implementation options

Mintlify offers two ways to implement headless documentation:

### Astro integration

Use the `@mintlify/astro` package to build a custom frontend with [Astro](https://astro.build). This integration processes your `docs.json` configuration and MDX content at build time, giving you full control over layouts, components, and styling.

**Best for**: Teams familiar with Astro who want a static site with custom design.

[Learn more about the Astro integration →](/guides/custom-frontend)

### API-based approach

Access your documentation content, search, and AI features through Mintlify's APIs. Build your frontend with any framework or technology stack, and fetch content and features as needed.

**Best for**: Teams with existing applications who want to integrate documentation programmatically.
