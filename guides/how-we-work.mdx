## Team processes and workflows

Our team follows structured processes to ensure consistent, high-quality output:

- **Daily standups** - Brief sync meetings to share progress and blockers
- **Weekly planning** - Review priorities and assign tasks for the upcoming week
- **Sprint retrospectives** - Reflect on what worked and what needs improvement
- **Documentation reviews** - All changes go through peer review before publishing

## Development methodology

We use an agile approach adapted to our documentation needs:

- **Iterative development** - Ship small, incremental improvements frequently
- **Version control** - All content is managed in Git with clear commit messages
- **Feature branches** - New content is developed in isolation before merging
- **Continuous integration** - Automated checks validate formatting and links on every commit

## Communication practices

Clear communication keeps our team aligned:

- **Async-first** - Default to written communication for transparency and flexibility
- **Dedicated channels** - Separate channels for different topics (announcements, questions, reviews)
- **Decision logs** - Document important decisions and their rationale
- **Regular syncs** - Scheduled meetings for discussions that benefit from real-time conversation

## Collaboration guidelines

We work together effectively by following these principles:

- **Ownership** - Each project has a clear owner responsible for driving it forward
- **Feedback culture** - Give and receive constructive feedback openly
- **Knowledge sharing** - Document learnings and share them with the team
- **Respect timezones** - Be mindful of colleagues in different locations when scheduling
