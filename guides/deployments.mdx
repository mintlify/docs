Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub app is installed on the account or organization that owns your docs repository. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/settings/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If the GitHub app is connected, but changes are still not deploying, you can manually trigger a rebuild from your dashboard.
