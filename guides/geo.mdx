Optimize your documentation for both traditional search engines and AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) focuses on being cited by AI systems through comprehensive content and structured information, while traditional SEO targets search result rankings.

## GEO best practices

In general, well written and well structured documentation will have strong GEO. You should still prioritize writing for your users, and if your content is meeting their needs, you will be well on your way to optimizing for AI tools. Creating genuinely helpful content rather than optimizing for optimization's sake is rewarded by both traditional and AI search engines.

Focus on:

- Content utility and comprehensive answers
- Structured, scannable information
- Direct answers to questions
- Semantic relevance over keyword matching

### Create comparison content

AI engines prioritize content that directly compares options and provides complete information.

For example, a comparison table:

```markdown
## API authentication methods

| Method | Security Level | Implementation | Best For |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| API Keys | Basic | Simple headers | Internal tools |
| OAuth 2.0 | High | Token exchange | User applications |
| JWT | Medium | Signed tokens | Stateless APIs |
```

### Answer questions directly

Structure documentation to address specific user questions:

- Begin sections with the main takeaway
- Use descriptive headings that match common queries
- Break complex topics into numbered steps

## Mintlify configuration

Use these 

### Enable LLMs.txt generation

Mintlify automatically generates LLMs.txt files. No additional configuration required.

<Info>
LLMs.txt files help AI systems understand your documentation structure, similar to how sitemaps help search engines.
</Info>

### Optimize page frontmatter

Add GEO-optimized metadata to each page:

```mdx
---
title: 'API Authentication Guide 2025'
description: 'Complete guide to implementing API authentication with code examples'
'og:title': 'API Authentication - Developer Guide'
'og:description': 'Learn how to implement secure API authentication'
---
```

### Configure global SEO settings

Add to your `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "seo": {
    "indexing": "all",
    "metatags": {
      "og:type": "website",
      "og:site_name": "Your Docs",
      "twitter:card": "summary_large_image"
    }
  }
}
```

## Content optimization

### Structure for AI scanning

- Use descriptive headings that answer questions
- Lead with direct answers before explanations
- Include numbered steps for procedures
- Add comparison tables for options
- Use bullet points for key information

### Technical formatting for AI readability

**Markdown structure requirements:**

- Use consistent heading hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Step down one level at a time: H1 → H2 → H3
- Avoid jumping from H1 directly to H3

```markdown
# Main Section
## Subsection  
### Specific Topic
#### Implementation Details
```

**Writing style guidelines:**

- Avoid ambiguous pronouns ("it", "this", "that")
- Use specific object names instead
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout documentation

```markdown
❌ Save it and restart
✅ Save the config.json file and restart the server

❌ This enables authentication
✅ OAuth 2.0 enables secure authentication
```

**Code formatting standards:**

- Use language-specific code block labels
- Wrap all code in fenced blocks with backticks
- Separate input and output examples clearly

```markdown
Install the package:
```bash
npm install @mintlify/components
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {}
}
```

**Image and media requirements:**

- Add descriptive alt text to all images
- Include text summaries for visual content
- Ensure content is understandable without viewing media

```mdx
![API authentication flow diagram showing OAuth 2.0 token exchange between client, authorization server, and resource server](./auth-flow.png)
```

### Internal linking strategy

Connect related concepts to help AI understand relationships:

```mdx
Learn about [API authentication](/auth/overview) before setting up [OAuth flows](/auth/oauth).

See also: [Rate limiting](/api/rate-limits) and [Error handling](/api/errors).
```

## Writing best practices

### Documentation standards

- **Lead with answers** - Start sections with direct solutions
- **Use current examples** - Include 2025 dates and modern tools
- **Add context** - Explain when and why to use features
- **Include troubleshooting** - Address common issues

### Content structure

- Clear, descriptive headings
- Numbered steps for procedures  
- Bullet points for key features
- Code examples with comments
- Comparison tables for options

<Note>
Use Mintlify components like Warning, Info, and Note to highlight important information that AI systems can better understand and cite.
</Note>

## Testing AI readability

### Validation methodology

Test your documentation with AI tools to ensure optimal readability:

**1. Use ChatGPT or similar AI tools**
- Ask specific workflow questions about your documentation
- Test if AI can find correct sections and extract accurate information
- Verify AI understands step-by-step processes

**2. Sample test prompts:**
```
"How do I set up authentication using this API?"
"What are the different pricing tiers and their features?"
"Walk me through the installation process step by step"
```

**3. Check for accuracy:**
- AI returns correct code samples
- No context mixing between different topics
- Accurate endpoint and method references
- Clear step-by-step explanations

**4. Common failure patterns:**
- AI confusing similar but different concepts
- Mixing code examples from different sections
- Inability to follow multi-step procedures
- Misunderstanding due to ambiguous language

## Measuring GEO performance

### Key metrics to track

| Metric Type | Traditional SEO | GEO (AI Search) |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Traffic | Organic search visits | Direct traffic spikes |
| Visibility | Keyword rankings | AI citation frequency |
| Engagement | Click-through rates | Conversion from AI referrals |

### Analytics setup

<Warning>
AI search traffic often appears as direct traffic. Monitor traffic patterns and add AI search sources to your attribution models.
</Warning>

Track these sources in your analytics:
- Direct traffic (often from AI)
- Brand searches (post-AI citation)
- Referrals from AI platforms when available

## Quick start checklist

### Initial setup

1. **Configure Mintlify SEO settings** in `docs.json`
2. **Audit current pages** for missing descriptions and titles
3. **Add structured frontmatter** to key pages
4. **Enable LLMs.txt generation** (automatic in Mintlify)

### Content optimization

1. **Rewrite page titles** to include current year and answer questions
2. **Add comparison tables** for feature documentation
3. **Create FAQ sections** for common user questions
4. **Improve internal linking** between related topics

### Ongoing maintenance

- Update time-sensitive content annually
- Monitor traffic patterns for AI referrals
- Add new comparison content quarterly
- Review and update FAQ sections monthly
