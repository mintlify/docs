A database that runs shell commands across files with tagging and filtering capabilities.

## Features

Shell DB currently supports these operations:
- `grep` - Search within files
- `ls` - Coming soon
- `awk` - Coming soon

Shell DB also supports file **tagging** to build complex filters that join multiple tags together.

## Running Shell DB

Use Docker to run Shell DB:

```bash
docker run cdxker/shelldb -p 8080:8080
```

## Architecture

Shell DB organizes files with the following structure:
- Files are stored within `${dataDir}/dataset_id/path/to/file`
- Tagged files are stored within `${dataDir}/dataset_id/___tag/path/to/file`

## Indexing files

### Basic indexing

Use the [`/api/index`](/api-reference/index/post-apiindex) endpoint to index files by sending the full file as a payload.

The `dataset` field specifies the index you want to add the file to. If the index doesn't exist, one will be created automatically.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/index \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dataset": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "filename": "test.txt",
    "file_payload": "override",
    "tags": []
  }'
```

### Adding tags

You can tag files during indexing by including tags in the request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/index \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dataset": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "filename": "test.txt",
    "file_payload": "override",
    "tags": ["private", "important"]
  }'
```

### Indexing from GitHub

Integration with GitHub repositories is coming soon.

## Searching

Use the `/api/search` endpoint to search across indexed files:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dataset": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "flags": "-r hello",
    "tags": []
  }'
```

### Search filters

You can filter search results by tags. To search only within files that have specific tags:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dataset": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "flags": "-r private -U",
    "tags": ["private"]
  }'
```

This example searches for the term "private" only within files tagged with "private".
