Improve your documentation based on quantitative and qualitative data from your insights page.

## Correlate traffic and satisfaction
- **High traffic and low feedback scores**: Popular pages with a poor user experience. Prioritize improving these pages.
- **Low traffic and high feedback scores**: Documentation that is working well, but might not be discoverable. Consider promoting these pages.
- **High traffic and high feedback scores**: Your documentation's greatest hits. Review these pages for ideas to improve the rest of your content.

## Put insights into action

Use these patterns to prioritize your documentation improvements:

- **Fix high-impact problems first**: Popular pages with poor feedback scores affect the most users.
- **Respond to user feedback**: Contextual and code snippet feedback can identify specific areas for improvement.
