Improve your documentation based on quantitative and qualitative data from your insights page.

## Cross-analytics insights

Combine information from multiple insights sources to get a holistic view of your documentation.

### Correlate traffic and satisfaction
- **High traffic and low feedback scores**: Popular pages with a poor user experience. Prioritize improving these pages.
- **Low traffic and high feedback scores**: Documentation that is working well, but might not be discoverable. Consider promoting these pages.
- **High traffic and high feedback scores**: Your documentation's greatest hits. Review these pages for ideas to improve the rest of your content.

### Match search intent with content performance
- **High search volume and low page views**: Discoverability problems. Consider moving these pages or reviewing their frontmatter.
- **Popular search terms and low-confidence results**: Content gap opportunity. Consider adding more content or new content on these topics.
- **Top searches and negative feedback on matching pages**: User experience issues. Review the pages to see if they solve the user need that is being searched for.

## Put insights into action

Use these cross-insights patterns to prioritize your documentation improvements:

- **Fix high-impact problems first**: Popular pages with poor feedback scores affect the most users.
- **Fill verified content gaps**: Low-confidence searches with high volume indicate unmet user needs.
- **Respond to user feedback**: Contextual and code snippet feedback can identify specific areas for improvement.
- **Align search and content**: Ensure your most-searched topics have comprehensive, well-organized pages.
- **Monitor rising search trends with no existing popular pages**: New content opportunities.
