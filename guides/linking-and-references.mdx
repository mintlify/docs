Effective linking creates a connected documentation experience that helps users discover related content and navigate efficiently. This guide covers how to create and maintain links throughout your documentation.

## Internal links

Link to other pages in your documentation using root-relative paths. Root-relative paths start from the root of your documentation directory and work consistently regardless of where the linking page is located.

### Basic internal links

Use standard Markdown link syntax with root-relative paths:

```mdx
[Quickstart guide](/quickstart)
[API overview](/api-playground/overview)
[Custom components](/customize/react-components)
```

[Quickstart guide](/quickstart)<br />
[API overview](/api-playground/overview)<br />
[Custom components](/customize/react-components)

<Tip>
  Always use root-relative paths (starting with `/`) for internal links. This ensures links work correctly even if you reorganize your documentation structure.
</Tip>

### Linking to nested pages

For pages in subdirectories, include the full path from the root:

```mdx
[Analytics integrations](/integrations/analytics/overview)
[Google Analytics setup](/integrations/analytics/google-analytics)
[Agent workflows](/agent/workflows)
```

## Anchor links

Anchor links allow you to link directly to specific sections within a page. Every header automatically generates an anchor link based on its text.

### Linking to sections on the same page

Reference headers on the current page using the hash symbol:

```mdx
[Jump to best practices](#best-practices)
[See troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting)
```

### Linking to sections on other pages

Combine page paths with anchor links:

```mdx
[Authentication setup](/api-playground/overview#authentication)
[Deployment options](/deploy/deployments#deployment-environments)
[Component props](/components/cards#properties)
```

[Authentication setup](/api-playground/overview#authentication)<br />
[Component props](/components/cards#properties)

### How anchor links are generated

Anchor links are automatically created from header text:

- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters
- Preserve numbers and letters

| Header text | Anchor link |
|-------------|-------------|
| `## Getting Started` | `#getting-started` |
| `### API Authentication` | `#api-authentication` |
| `#### Step 1: Install` | `#step-1-install` |

<Note>
  Headers with the `noAnchor` prop will not generate anchor links. See [Format text](/create/text#disabling-anchor-links) for details.
</Note>

## Referencing API endpoints

When documenting APIs, you can reference specific endpoints from anywhere in your documentation.

### Linking to API pages

Reference API endpoint pages using their path in the navigation:

```mdx
[User endpoints](/api-reference/users)
[Create user endpoint](/api-reference/post-users)
[Authentication API](/api-reference/auth)
```

### OpenAPI endpoint references

For OpenAPI-generated documentation, reference endpoints by their operation:

```mdx
[GET /users endpoint](/api-reference/get-users)
[POST /users endpoint](/api-reference/post-users)
[DELETE /users/{id}](/api-reference/delete-users-id)
```

The exact path depends on how your OpenAPI specification is configured in your navigation. See [OpenAPI setup](/api-playground/openapi-setup) for details on configuring API documentation.

### Linking to specific API sections

Combine endpoint paths with anchor links to reference specific parts of API documentation:

```mdx
[Request parameters](/api-reference/get-users#request)
[Response schema](/api-reference/post-users#response)
[Authentication headers](/api-reference/overview#authentication)
```

## Cross-referencing components

Reference component documentation to help users discover available UI elements.

### Linking to component pages

```mdx
[Card component](/components/cards)
[Accordion component](/components/accordions)
[Code groups](/components/code-groups)
```

### Referencing component properties

Link to specific component properties or examples:

```mdx
[Card properties](/components/cards#properties)
[Accordion examples](/components/accordions#examples)
[Code group usage](/components/code-groups#usage)
```

### Inline component references

When mentioning components in text, link to their documentation:

```mdx
Use the [Callout component](/components/callouts) to highlight important information.

The [Steps component](/components/steps) helps create sequential instructions.

Add code examples with [CodeGroup](/components/code-groups) for multiple languages.
```

## Best practices

### Write descriptive link text

Use clear, descriptive text that indicates what users will find when they click:

<CodeGroup>

```mdx Good examples
[Learn about authentication](/api-playground/overview#authentication)
[View deployment options](/deploy/deployments)
[Configure custom domains](/customize/custom-domain)
```

```mdx Avoid
[Click here](/api-playground/overview#authentication)
[Read more](/deploy/deployments)
[See this page](/customize/custom-domain)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Create topic clusters

Link related content together to help users discover relevant information:

```mdx
## Related topics

- [API authentication](/api-playground/overview#authentication)
- [Adding SDK examples](/api-playground/adding-sdk-examples)
- [Managing page visibility](/api-playground/managing-page-visibility)
```

### Use contextual links

Add links naturally within content where they provide value:

```mdx
To customize your documentation appearance, configure [themes](/customize/themes) 
and [fonts](/customize/fonts) in your settings. You can also add 
[custom scripts](/customize/custom-scripts) for advanced functionality.
```

### Link to prerequisites

Help users prepare by linking to prerequisite content:

```mdx
## Prerequisites

Before deploying your documentation, ensure you have:

- Completed the [quickstart guide](/quickstart)
- Configured your [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain)
- Set up [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup) if needed
```

## Maintaining links

### Check for broken links

Use the Mintlify CLI to identify broken links in your documentation:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

This command scans all pages and reports:
- Links to non-existent pages
- Invalid anchor references
- Broken external URLs

### Update links when reorganizing

When moving or renaming pages:

1. Update the page path in your navigation configuration
2. Search your documentation for references to the old path
3. Update all internal links to use the new path
4. Run `mint broken-links` to verify all links work

### Use redirects for moved content

When permanently moving content, add redirects to prevent broken links:

```mdx Old page (old-path.mdx)
---
title: "Moved Content"
---

This content has moved to [new location](/new-path).
```

Or configure redirects in your `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/old-path",
      "destination": "/new-path"
    }
  ]
}
```

See [Redirects](/create/redirects) for complete redirect configuration options.

### Regular link audits

Establish a maintenance schedule:

- Run `mint broken-links` before each deployment
- Review and update external links quarterly
- Check anchor links when updating page structure
- Verify API endpoint links when updating OpenAPI specifications

## Handling broken links

### Internal broken links

When the CLI reports broken internal links:

1. Verify the target page exists in your documentation
2. Check the page is included in your navigation
3. Confirm the path matches the file location
4. Update the link or create the missing page

### Broken anchor links

For broken anchor references:

1. Verify the target header exists on the page
2. Check the header text matches the anchor format
3. Ensure the header doesn't use `noAnchor` prop
4. Update the anchor link to match the actual header

### External broken links

For broken external URLs:

1. Verify the external site is accessible
2. Check if the URL has changed or moved
3. Update to the new URL or remove the link
4. Consider linking to archived versions if content is removed

## Advanced linking techniques

### Linking with custom text

Override default link behavior with custom attributes:

```mdx
[Open in new tab](https://external-site.com){target="_blank"}
```

### Linking to external documentation

When referencing external resources, make it clear the link goes outside your documentation:

```mdx
Learn more about [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (external link).

See the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) for details.
```

### Navigation-based linking

Ensure all important pages are accessible through your navigation structure, not just through links. Users should be able to discover content through browsing, not only through following links.

See [Navigation](/organize/navigation) for guidance on structuring your documentation hierarchy.
