Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your documentation and enables team collaboration. With Git, you can see what changed over time in files, who made the changes, when they made changes, and why. Git also makes it easy to revert to previous versions of files if you need to undo changes.

## Why Git for documentation?

Git provides essential capabilities for managing documentation.

- **Version history**: See what changed, when, and why for every file.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on different parts simultaneously.
- **Safety**: Experiment without breaking live documentation.
- **Review workflows**: Team members can review changes before publishing.
- **Recovery**: Undo mistakes or restore previous versions.

## New to Git?

If you're completely new to Git and version control, here's a path to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Learn the basics.">
    Start with [the GitHub quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) to understand core Git concepts.

    - **Commits** save your changes with a description.
    - **Branches** let you work on changes without affecting the main version.
    - **Pull requests** let team members review changes before publishing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your local environment.">
    Install Git and clone your documentation repository to start editing locally.

    - Create and edit files in your favorite editor.
    - Use command line Git, GitHub desktop, or an extension in your editor.
    - Preview changes locally before publishing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Practice with your documentation.">
    Start making small changes to get comfortable with Git workflows.

    - Create a branch for your changes.
    - Make edits and commit them.
    - Push your branch and open a pull request.
    - Integrate with other tools like support tickets, issue tracking, and design systems.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core Git concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Branch">
    A branch points to a specific commit in your repository. Your live documentation builds from a deployment branch. You can have any number of other branches with changes that are not yet published to your live documentation. If you want to incorporate the changes from a branch into your live documentation, you can merge the branch into your deployment branch through a pull request.

    Use branches to work on changes without affecting your live documentation, safely experiment with new features, and get reviews before publishing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clone">
    Download a complete copy of a repository to your computer, including all files and full history. When you clone, you get everything needed to work locally.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Commit">
    A saved snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time. Each commit includes a message describing what changed and creates a permanent record in your project history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflict">
    Occurs when two people change the same part of a file differently. Git asks you to manually choose which change to keep or combine both changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deployment branch">
    The primary branch of your project. Changes to this branch automatically publish to your documentation site. Often called `main`, but you can set any branch as your deployment branch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Diff">
    A diff (or difference) shows the changes between two versions of a file. When reviewing pull requests, diffs highlight what is different from the original version of the file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Merge">
    Combine changes from one branch into another. Usually done via pull request after review to incorporate feature work into your deployment branch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pull">
    Get the latest changes from the remote repository to your local copy. Keeps you up to date with other people's work.

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Pull request">
    A way to propose merging your changes on a branch into your live documentation. Allows for review and discussion before changes go live. Commonly called a PR, and also called a merge request in GitLab.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push">
    Send your local commits to the remote repository. This makes your changes available to others and can trigger automatic deployments.

    ```bash
    git push
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remote">
    A version of your repository hosted on a server. Your local repository connects to a remote repository to push and pull changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repository">
    Your documentation's source code with all the files, and their history, that make up the pages of your documentation site.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stage">
    Prepare specific changes to include in your next commit. Staging lets you organize changes into logical commits.

    ```bash
    git add filename.mdx
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common workflows

### Publish directly to your deployment branch

1. Pull the latest changes: `git pull`
2. Edit file in your editor.
3. Stage changes: `git add filename.mdx`
4. Commit: `git commit -m "Update documentation"`
5. Push: `git push`
6. Changes deploy automatically.

### Work on a feature branch

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Make and commit changes.
3. Push branch: `git push -u origin feature-name`
4. Create a pull request.
5. Merge the pull request when ready.

### Review changes before publishing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a feature branch.">
    Work on changes in a branch separate from your deployment branch so that you can share and review the changes before publishing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes.">
    Edit files and commit changes to the feature branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a pull request.">
    Create a pull request to propose merging the changes on your feature branch into the deployment branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the diff.">
    Check your changes. The pull request shows line-by-line differences from the original version of the file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get team feedback.">
    Team members can comment on specific lines or overall changes. Make any changes and commit them to the feature branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge when approved.">
    Merge the pull request to publish changes to your live documentation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Git best practices

Every team develops their own workflows and preferences, but these are some general best practices to get started.

- **Write descriptive commit messages**: Be specific about what changed using active language. `Fix broken link in API docs` is more informative than `update page`.
- **Use descriptive branch names**: Branch names should explain the purpose the branch. Use informative names like `update-api-reference` instead of generic names like `temp` or `my-branch`.
- **Keep branches focused**: Keep the changes on a branch focused on a specific task or project. This makes reviews easier and reduces conflicts.
- **Delete branches after merging**: Delete branches when you no longer need them to keep your repository tidy.
- **Pull before you push**: Always pull the latest changes before pushing to avoid conflicts.
- **Review your own changes first**: Check the diff before creating a pull request.
