A custom frontend lets you control how your documentation looks and behaves while using Mintlify to manage your content. Instead of using Mintlify's hosted frontend, you build your own with [Astro](https://astro.build) and render your MDX content and `docs.json` configuration however you want.

This is useful when you need full control over your documentation's design, layout, or behavior—for example, to match an existing design system or embed documentation into a larger site.

The `@mintlify/astro` integration reads your `docs.json` config and MDX content at build time, then processes everything into a format Astro can render. You use your own layouts, components, and styles on top of it.

- **Your content, your design**: Write content in MDX with `docs.json` navigation, then render it with custom Astro layouts and styles.
- **Mintlify components**: Use Mintlify components like Cards, Accordions, Steps, and CodeGroups in your MDX without importing them.
- **Search and assistant**: Connect to Mintlify's [assistant](/ai/assistant) and search APIs so your users get AI-powered answers from your content.

## Prerequisites

- A [Mintlify account](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or later
- Familiarity with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build)

## Set up your project

The fastest way to get started is to clone the starter repository.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the starter repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mintlify/mintlify-astro-starter.git my-docs
    cd my-docs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file at the project root with your Mintlify credentials:

    ```bash .env
    PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_ASSISTANT_KEY=your-assistant-api-key
    PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_SUBDOMAIN=your-subdomain
    ```

    Find these values in your [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the dev server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:4321`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

The integration connects three parts: the Astro build system, your content in the `docs/` directory, and the Mintlify packages that process and render that content.

### Astro configuration

Configure the `mintlify()` integration in `astro.config.mjs` with the path to your docs directory:

```javascript astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import { mintlify } from '@mintlify/astro';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mintlify({ docsDir: './docs' }), react(), mdx()],
});
```

At build time, the integration reads your `docs.json` and MDX files from the `docsDir` path and processes them into `.mintlify/docs/`, where Astro's content collections pick them up.

### Content structure

Your documentation content lives in the `docs/` directory, structured the same way as any Mintlify project:

```text
docs/
├── docs.json          # Navigation and site configuration
├── index.mdx
├── quickstart.mdx
└── guides/
    ├── setup.mdx
    └── advanced.mdx
```

MDX files use standard Mintlify frontmatter (`title`, `description`, `icon`) and can use Mintlify components without importing them.

### Routing and navigation

A catch-all route in `src/pages/[...slug].astro` renders each doc page. The `@mintlify/astro/helpers` package provides functions to resolve navigation state from your `docs.json`:

- `resolvePageData()`—returns tabs, sidebar navigation, footer links, and anchors for a given page path.
- `unwrapNav()`—flattens the navigation tree into a list for sidebar rendering.

### Layouts and styling

You control the full presentation layer. The starter includes layouts, a sidebar, table of contents, and styles built with Tailwind CSS, but you can replace any of these with your own.

Key files to customize:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/layouts/Layout.astro` | Root HTML layout |
| `src/pages/[...slug].astro` | Page template and data loading |
| `src/components/Header.astro` | Site header |
| `src/components/Sidebar/` | Sidebar navigation |
| `src/components/TableOfContents.tsx` | On-page table of contents |
| `src/styles/` | Global styles, typography, and color scheme |

## Connect search and assistant

The starter includes search and assistant components that connect to Mintlify's APIs using the environment variables you configured during setup.

- **Search**—the `SearchBar` component in `src/components/SearchBar.tsx` queries the Mintlify search API.
- **Assistant**—the `Assistant` component in `src/components/Assistant/` provides an AI chat interface that answers questions using your documentation content.

Both require the `PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_SUBDOMAIN` and `PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_ASSISTANT_KEY` environment variables.

## Next steps

After setting up your project:

1. Replace the starter content in `docs/` with your own MDX files and `docs.json` configuration.
2. Customize layouts and styles to match your design system.
3. Deploy your Astro site to your preferred hosting provider.
