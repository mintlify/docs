A custom frontend lets you control how your documentation looks and behaves while using Mintlify to manage your content. Instead of using Mintlify's hosted frontend, you can build your own with [Astro](https://astro.build) and render your MDX content and `docs.json` configuration however you want.

This is useful when you need full control over your documentation's design, layout, or behavior. For example, to match an existing design system or embed documentation into a larger site.

The `@mintlify/astro` integration reads your `docs.json` config and MDX content at build time, then processes everything into a format that Astro can render. Use your own layouts, components, and styles on top of it.

With a custom frontend, you can still use Mintlify components without importing them and you have the publishing, search, and AI infrastructure.

This guide walks you through setting up a new project with the starter template and getting it running locally.

## Prerequisites

- A [Mintlify account](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20.17.0 or later (LTS versions recommended)
- Familiarity with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build)

## Set up your project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a repository from the starter template">
    Navigate to the [mintlify-astro-starter](https://github.com/mintlify/mintlify-astro-starter) repository on GitHub and click **Use this template** to create a new repository on your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign up for Mintlify">
    If you don't have a Mintlify account, sign up at [dashboard.mintlify.com/signup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/signup).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the GitHub app">
    On the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page of your Mintlify dashboard, install the [Mintlify GitHub app](/deploy/github). If you already have the app installed, uninstall it and reinstall it so that you are ready to connect your new repository.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your repository">
    1. On the [Git settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) page, select the repository you created from the starter template.
    2. Enable the **Set up as monorepo** toggle.
    3. Enter `/docs` as the path to the directory containing your `docs.json` file.
    4. Click **Save changes**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Clone your new repository locally and create a `.env` file at the project root with your Mintlify credentials:

    ```bash .env
    PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_ASSISTANT_KEY=your-assistant-api-key
    PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_SUBDOMAIN=your-subdomain
    ```
    
    Generate an assistant API key on the [API keys](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys) page of your dashboard. The assistant API key starts with `mint_dsc_`.
    
    Your subdomain is the domain name of your project. It is the part of your dashboard URL after the organization name. For example, if your dashboard URL is `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/org-name/domain-name`, your subdomain is `domain-name`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the dev server">
    Install dependencies and start the local development server:

    ```bash
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```

    Your site now runs locally at `http://localhost:4321`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

The integration connects three parts: the Astro build system, your content in the `docs/` directory, and the Mintlify packages that process and render that content.

### Astro configuration

Configure the `mintlify()` integration in `astro.config.mjs` with the path to your docs directory:

```javascript astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import { mintlify } from '@mintlify/astro';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mintlify({ docsDir: './docs' }), react(), mdx()],
});
```

At build time, the integration reads your `docs.json` and MDX files from the `docsDir` path and processes them into `.mintlify/docs/`, where Astro's content collections pick them up.

### Content structure

Your documentation content lives in the `docs/` directory, structured the same way as any other Mintlify project:

```text
docs/
├── docs.json          # Navigation and site configuration
├── index.mdx          # MDX pages for content
├── quickstart.mdx
└── guides/            # Directories for organizing pages
    ├── setup.mdx
    └── troubleshooting.mdx
```

MDX files use standard Mintlify [frontmatter](/organize/pages#page-metadata) and can use Mintlify components without importing them.

### Routing and navigation

A catch-all route renders each MDX page. The `@mintlify/astro/helpers` package provides functions to resolve navigation state from your `docs.json`.

- `resolvePageData()`: Returns tabs, sidebar navigation, footer links, and anchors for a given page path.
- `unwrapNav()`: Flattens the navigation tree into a list for sidebar rendering.

### Layouts and styling

You control the full presentation layer. The starter template includes layouts, a sidebar, table of contents, and styles built with Tailwind CSS, but you can replace any of these with your own.

Key files to customize:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/layouts/Layout.astro` | Root HTML layout |
| `src/pages/[...slug].astro` | Page template and data loading |
| `src/components/Header.astro` | Site header |
| `src/components/Sidebar/` | Sidebar navigation |
| `src/components/TableOfContents.tsx` | On-page table of contents |
| `src/styles/` | Global styles, typography, and color scheme |

## Connect search and assistant

The starter template includes search and assistant components that connect to Mintlify's APIs using the environment variables you configure during setup.

- **Search**: The `SearchBar` component in `src/components/SearchBar.tsx` queries the Mintlify search API.
- **Assistant**: The `Assistant` component in `src/components/Assistant/` provides an AI chat interface that answers questions using your documentation content.

Both require the `PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_SUBDOMAIN` and `PUBLIC_MINTLIFY_ASSISTANT_KEY` environment variables.

## Next steps

After setting up your project:

1. Replace the starter content in `docs/` with your own MDX files and `docs.json` configuration.
2. Customize layouts and styles to match your design system.
3. Deploy your Astro site to your preferred hosting provider.
