## Prerequisites

- [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine
- A terminal or command prompt
- Access to your repository

## Clone a repository

Download a repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

## Check status

View which files have been modified:

```bash
git status
```

## Stage changes

Add files to be committed:

```bash
# Stage a specific file
git add filename.mdx

# Stage all changes
git add .
```

## Commit changes

Save your staged changes with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add new documentation page"
```

## Push changes

Upload your commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Replace `main` with your branch name if working on a different branch.

## Pull changes

Download and merge changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Create a branch

Work on changes without affecting the main branch:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-page

# Push the new branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/new-page
```

## Switch branches

Move between existing branches:

```bash
git checkout main
```

## Merge branches

Combine changes from another branch:

```bash
# Switch to the target branch
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/new-page
```

## View commit history

See previous commits:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## Undo changes

Discard uncommitted changes to a file:

```bash
git checkout -- filename.mdx
```

Reset staged files:

```bash
git reset filename.mdx
```
