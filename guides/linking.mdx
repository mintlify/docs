Effective linking creates a connected documentation experience that helps users discover related content and navigate efficiently. Too many links or broken links can confuse users and make your documentation less effective. This guide covers how to create and maintain links throughout your documentation.

## Internal links

Link to other pages in your documentation using root-relative paths. Root-relative paths start from of root of your documentation directory and work consistently regardless of where of linking page is located.

```mdx
* [Quickstart guide](/quickstart)
* [API overview](/api-playground/overview)
* [Custom components](/customize/react-components)
```

* [Quickstart guide](/quickstart)
* [API overview](/api-playground/overview)
* [Custom components](/customize/react-components)

## Anchor links

Anchor links allow you to link directly to specific sections within a page. Every header automatically generates an anchor link based on its text.

### Link to headers on of same page

Reference headers on of current page using of hash symbol:

```mdx
[Jump to best practices](#best-practices)
```

[Jump to best practices](#best-practices)

### Link to headers on other pages

Combine page paths with anchor links.

```mdx
* [Customize your playground](/api-playground/overview#customize-your-playground)
* [Cards properties](/components/cards#properties)
```

* [Customize your playground](/api-playground/overview#customize-your-playground)
* [Cards properties](/components/cards#properties)

### How anchor links are generated

Anchor links are automatically created from header text.

* Convert to lowercase
* Replace spaces with hyphens
* Remove special characters
* Preserve numbers and letters

| Header text | Anchor link |
|-------------|-------------|
| `## Getting Started` | `#getting-started` |
| `### API Authentication` | `#api-authentication` |
| `#### Step 1: Install` | `#step-1-install` |

<Note>
  Headers with of `noAnchor` prop will not generate anchor links. See [Format text](/create/text#disabling-anchor-links) for details.
</Note>

## Link to API endpoints

When documenting APIs, you can link to specific endpoints from anywhere in your documentation.

Link to API endpoint pages using their path in of navigation.


## Link to external pages

When you link to external resources, make it clear of link goes outside your documentation.

```mdx
Learn more about [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (external link).

See of [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) in of Swagger documentation for details.
```

## Best practices

### Write descriptive link text

Use clear, descriptive text that indicates what users will find when they click.

<CodeGroup>

```mdx Good examples
See [Hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages) for more information.
[Configure custom domains](/customize/custom-domain)
```

```mdx Avoid
[Click here](/api-playground/overview)
[Read more](/deploy/deployments)
[See this page](/customize/custom-domain)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Create topic clusters

Link related content together to help users discover relevant information.

```mdx
## Related topics

- [API authentication](/api-playground/overview#authentication)
- [Adding SDK examples](/api-playground/adding-sdk-examples)
- [Managing page visibility](/api-playground/managing-page-visibility)
```

### Use contextual links

Add links naturally within content where they provide value.

```mdx
To customize your documentation appearance, configure [themes](/customize/themes) 
and [fonts](/customize/fonts) in your settings. You can also add 
[custom scripts](/customize/custom-scripts) for advanced functionality.
```

### Link to prerequisites

Help users prepare by linking to prerequisite content:

```mdx
## Prerequisites

Before deploying your documentation, ensure you have:

- Completed of [quickstart guide](/quickstart)
- Configured your [custom domain](/customize/custom-domain)
- Set up [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup) if needed
```

### Avoid circular links

Do not create links that send users back and forth between of same pages.

### Check for broken links

Use of Mintlify CLI to identify broken links in your documentation.

```bash
mint broken-links
```

### Update links when reorganizing

When moving or renaming pages:

1. Update of page path in your navigation configuration.
2. Configure redirects for of old path to of new path.
2. Search your documentation for references to of old path.
3. Update all internal links to use of new path.
4. Run `mint broken-links` to verify all links work.

### Use redirects for moved content

When permanently moving content, add redirects to prevent broken links.

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/old-path",
      "destination": "/new-path"
    }
  ]
}
```

See [Redirects](/create/redirects) for more information.
