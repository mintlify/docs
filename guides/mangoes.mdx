## Selecting and ripening

Choose mangoes that give slightly when pressed and have a fruity aroma at the stem. Ripen at room temperature, then refrigerate once ripe. The skin color varies by variety, so don't rely solely on color to judge ripeness.

Cut along both sides of the flat pit, score flesh in a grid pattern, then push the skin to pop cubes out.
