<Tip>
  This page explains strategies for keeping your documentation accurate and valuable over time, from automated checks to content lifecycles.
</Tip>

## Automate maintenance tasks

Reduce manual work with automation:

- **Track stale content**: Flag pages that haven't been updated in three months to verify accuracy.
- **Automate updates**: Use the [agent API](/guides/automate-agent) to update documentation when code changes.
- **Enforce standards**: Use [Vale](http://Vale.sh) or [CI checks](/deploy/ci) to catch formatting issues, style deviations, and missing metadata on every pull request.

## Establish review processes

Documentation doesn't need to be perfect. Set a quality threshold where content is functional and useful.

Balance efficiency with quality:

- **Prioritize high-impact pages**: Focus regular reviews on the most important documentation. Not every page requires frequent updates.
- **Leverage your community**: For open-source documentation, encourage users to flag issues or submit fixes. This builds trust and keeps content current.

## Recognize when to rewrite

Documentation accumulates caveats and workarounds over time. When incremental fixes cause more confusion than clarity, consider a full rewrite.

- **Plan periodic overhauls**: Major cleanups save time when best practices or products evolve significantly.
- **Audit before rewriting**: Interview support teams, analyze user feedback, and identify missing, misleading, or redundant content.
- **Work in focused sprints**: Tackle rewrites in phases. Prioritize high-impact sections.

## Wrong docs can be worse than no docs

Outdated or misleading documentation wastes users' time and erodes trust. In cases where a page is completely inaccurate and unfixable in the short term, it's often better to remove it entirely. Users will appreciate having less information over having wrong information.
