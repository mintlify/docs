Hidden pages are removed from your site's navigation while remaining publicly accessible to anyone who knows their URL.

Use hidden pages for content that you want to be accessible on your site, but not discoverable through the navigation. For content requiring strict access control, you must configure [authentication](/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup).

If you want to hide pages for specific groups of users, use personalization to control [page visibility](/authentication-personalization/overview#page-visibility).

## Hiding a page

A page is hidden if it is not included in your `docs.json` navigation. To hide a page, remove it from your navigation structure.

<Note>
Some navigation elements like sidebars, dropdowns, and tabs may appear empty or shift layout on hidden pages.

## Search and SEO

By default, hidden pages are excluded from indexing for search engines and internal search within your docs. To include hidden pages in search results, add this setting to your `docs.json`:

```
"seo" {
    "indexing": all
}
```

To exclude a specific page from search, add `noindex: true` to its frontmatter.
