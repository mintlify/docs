Hidden pages are removed from your site's navigation but remain publicly accessible to anyone who knows their URL.

Use hidden pages for content that you want to be accessible on your site or referenced as context for AI tools, but not discoverable through the navigation.

For content requiring strict access control, you must configure [protected pages](/protected-pages/overview).

## Hiding a page

A page is hidden if it is not included in your `docs.json` navigation. To hide a page, remove it from your navigation structure.

Hidden pages use the same URL structure as regular pages based on their file path.  For example,  `guides/hidden-page.mdx` would be accessible at `docs.yoursite.com/guides/hidden-page`.

See an [example of a hidden page](/guides/hidden-page-example).

<Note>
  Some navigation elements like sidebars, dropdowns, and tabs may appear empty or shift layout on hidden pages.

## Search, SEO, and AI indexing

By default, hidden pages are excluded from indexing for search engines, internal search within your docs, and as context for the AI assistant. To include hidden pages in search results and as context for the assistant, add the `seo` property to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "indexing": "all"
}
```

To exclude a specific page, add `noindex: "true"` to its frontmatter.
