Use internationalization (i18n) to provide documentation in multiple languages. Multi-language documentation helps users access content in their preferred language and improves global reach.

## File structure

Organize translated content in language-specific directories to keep your documentation maintainable.

### Directory organization

Create a separate directory for each language using [ISO 639-1 language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). Place translated files in these directories with the same structure as your default language.

```
docs/
├── index.mdx                    # English (default)
├── quickstart.mdx
├── fr/
│   ├── index.mdx               # French
│   ├── quickstart.mdx
├── es/
│   ├── index.mdx               # Spanish
│   ├── quickstart.mdx
└── zh/
    ├── index.mdx               # Chinese
    └── quickstart.mdx
```

- `ua` - Ukrainian
- `uz` - Uzbek

## Configure the language switcher

Add a language switcher to your documentation by configuring the `languages` array in your `docs.json` navigation.

### Basic configuration

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "languages": [
      {
        "language": "en",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting started",
            "pages": ["index", "quickstart"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "language": "es",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Comenzando",
            "pages": ["es/index", "es/quickstart"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Navigation structure

Each language entry requires:

- `language`: ISO 639-1 language code
- Full navigation structure (groups, pages, tabs, etc.)
- Paths to translated files

The navigation structure can differ between languages to accommodate language-specific content needs.

### Global navigation

Use global navigation elements that appear across all languages:

```json docs.json
{
  "navigation": {
    "global": {
      "anchors": [
        {
          "anchor": "Documentation",
          "href": "https://example.com/docs"
        },
        {
          "anchor": "Blog",
          "href": "https://example.com/blog"
        }
      ]
    },
    "languages": [
      // Language-specific navigation
    ]
  }
}
```

## Maintain translations

Keep translations accurate and synchronized with your source content.

### Translation workflow

1. Update the source language (typically English)
2. Identify changed content
3. Translate updated content
4. Review translations for accuracy
5. Update translated files
6. Verify all internal links work

### Track translation status

Use comments in frontmatter to track translation metadata:

```mdx
---
title: "Getting started"
description: "Learn how to get started with our product."
# translated: 2024-01-15
# source_hash: abc123
---
```

## Handle language-specific content

### Images and media

Store translated images in language-specific directories:

```
images/
├── dashboard.png          # English version
├── fr/
│   └── dashboard.png     # French version
└── es/
    └── dashboard.png     # Spanish version
```

Reference images using relative paths in your translated content:

```mdx es/index.mdx
![Dashboard screenshot](/images/es/dashboard.png)
```

### Code examples

Keep code examples in the original language when they contain:

- Programming syntax
- API endpoints
- Configuration files

Translate only:

- Code comments
- Variable and function names (when clarity requires it)
- Output examples

```javascript
// Spanish translation
// Crear un nuevo usuario
function crearUsuario(nombre, email) {
  return api.post('/users', {
    name: nombre,
    email: email
  });
}
```

### Date and number formats

Consider locale-specific formatting:

- Date formats (MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY)
- Number formats (1,000.00 vs 1.000,00)
- Currency symbols

Include examples in the appropriate format for each language.

## SEO for multi-language sites

Optimize each language version for search engines.

### Page metadata

Include translated metadata in each file's frontmatter:

```mdx fr/index.mdx
---
title: "Commencer"
description: "Apprenez à commencer avec notre produit."
keywords: ["démarrage", "tutoriel", "guide"]
---
```

### URL structure

Use clean, language-specific URLs:

- English: `https://example.com/docs/quickstart`
- French: `https://example.com/docs/fr/quickstart`
- Spanish: `https://example.com/docs/es/quickstart`

### Internal linking

Link between language versions of the same page when appropriate. This helps users switch languages while staying on the same topic.

Consider adding a note at the top of partially translated sections:

<Note>
This page is also available in [English](/quickstart) and [French](/fr/quickstart).
</Note>

## Best practices

### Start small

Begin with high-priority pages:

1. Homepage and overview
2. Getting started guides
3. Most-visited pages

Expand to additional pages based on user demand.

### Maintain consistency

- Use the same translator for related content
- Create a translation glossary for technical terms
- Keep the same content structure across languages
- Match the tone and style of your source content

### Test thoroughly

Before publishing translations:

- [ ] Verify all internal links work
- [ ] Check images display correctly
- [ ] Confirm code examples are clear
- [ ] Test the language switcher
- [ ] Review metadata for each page
- [ ] Validate that search works in each language

### Monitor usage

Track which languages users prefer:

- Page views by language
- Search queries in each language
- Time spent on translated pages

Use this data to prioritize translation efforts.

## Common issues

### Broken links

Translated pages often reference English pages by mistake. Use root-relative paths and verify links point to translated versions:

```mdx
<!-- Incorrect -->
[Learn more](/quickstart)

<!-- Correct for Spanish version -->
[Más información](/es/quickstart)
```

### Missing translations

When a translation doesn't exist, decide whether to:

- Link to the English version with a note
- Hide the link in that language
- Show a placeholder indicating translation is in progress

### Layout differences

Some languages require more or less space than English. Test your translated content on different screen sizes to ensure:

- Navigation fits properly
- Code blocks don't overflow
- Tables remain readable
- Images scale appropriately

### Character encoding

Ensure your development environment and deployment pipeline support UTF-8 encoding to properly display all characters in languages like Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and languages with special characters.
