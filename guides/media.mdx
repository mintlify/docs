<Tip>
  This page explains best practices for using screenshots, GIFs, and videos in your documentation.
</Tip>

Screenshots, GIFs, and videos enhance documentation but require maintenance as UI changes. Use them selectively to minimize upkeep.

Key guidelines:

- **Keep media supplementary**: If text explains a workflow clearly, skip visuals.
- **Ensure accessibility**: Add alt text for images, subtitles for videos, and transcripts for audio. Accessible content benefits all users.
- **Balance value with maintenance**: UI changes quickly outdate screenshots and videos. Consider whether update effort matches added value.

## When to use media

- **Screenshots**: Tasks difficult to explain with words alone.
- **GIFs**: Short complex workflows or promotional content.
- **Videos**: Abstract concepts and lengthy workflows.

Use media sparingly and intentionally. Effective media enhances comprehension without creating maintenance burdens or accessibility barriers.
