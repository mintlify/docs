<Tip>
  This page explains best practices for using screenshots, GIFs, and videos in your documentation.
</Tip>

Screenshots, GIFs, and videos can enhance documentation but require ongoing maintenance as UI elements change. Use them selectively to avoid unnecessary upkeep.

## Managing media assets

The [visual editor](/editor) includes an Images and Media view that helps you browse, preview, and manage your documentation assets. Access it from the sidebar to:

- Browse assets in tree or gallery view
- Preview images and videos with metadata
- View file paths, dimensions, and file sizes
- Search and filter assets by name

This makes it easier to find and reference existing media when creating documentation.

Key guidelines:

- **Media should be supplementary.** If a workflow is clear in text alone, avoid adding visuals.
- **Ensure accessibility.** Add alt text for images, subtitles for videos, and transcripts for audio content. Many people use assistive technology and accessible content benefits all users.
- **Balance clarity with maintainability.** Frequent UI changes can make screenshots and videos outdated quickly. Consider whether the effort to update them is worth the value they add.

## When to use media

* **Screenshots** for tasks that are difficult to explain with words.
* **GIFs** for promotional purposes and short yet complex workflows.
* **Videos** for abstract concepts and long workflows.

Use media sparingly and intentionally to avoid unnecessary documentation debt. When done right, it enhances comprehension without adding maintenance burdens or accessibility barriers.
