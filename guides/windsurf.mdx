Transform Windsurf into a documentation expert that understands your style guide, components, and project context through workspace rules and memories.

## Using Windsurf with Mintlify

Windsurf's Cascade AI assistant can be tuned to write documentation according to your standards using Mintlify components. Workspace rules and memories provide persistent context about your project, ensuring more consistent suggestions from Cascade.

* **Workspace rules** are stored in your documentation repository and shared with your team.
* **Memories** provide individual context that builds up over time.

We recommend setting up workspace rules for shared documentation standards. You can develop memories as you work, but since they are not shared, they will not be consistent across team members.

Create workspace rules in the `.windsurf/rules` directory of your docs repo. See [Memories & Rules](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/memories) in the Windsurf documentation for more information.

## Example workspace rule

This rule provides Cascade with context about Mintlify components and general technical writing best practices.

You can use this example rule as-is or customize it for your documentation:

* **Writing standards**: Update language guidelines to match your style guide.
* **Component patterns**: Add project-specific components or modify existing examples.
* **Code examples**: Replace generic examples with real API calls and responses for your product.
* **Style and tone preferences**: Adjust terminology, formatting, and other rules.

Save your rule as a `.md` file in the `.windsurf/rules` directory of your docs repo.

# Mintlify technical writing rule

## Project context

- This is a documentation project on the Mintlify platform
- We use MDX files with YAML frontmatter  
- Navigation is configured in `docs.json`
- We follow technical writing best practices

## Writing standards

- Use second person ("you") for instructions
- Write in active voice and present tense
- Start procedures with prerequisites
- Include expected outcomes for major steps
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich headings
- Keep sentences concise but informative

## Required page structure

Every page must start with frontmatter:

```yaml

## Working with Cascade

Once your rules are set up, you can use Cascade to assist with various documentation tasks. See [Cascade](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade) in the Windsurf documentation for more information.

### Example prompts

**Writing new content**:
```text wrap
Create a new page explaining how to authenticate with our API. Include code examples in JavaScript, Python, and cURL.
```

**Improving existing content**:
```text wrap
Review this page and suggest improvements for clarity and component usage. Focus on making the steps easier to follow.
```

**Creating code examples**:
```text wrap
Generate a complete code example showing error handling for this API endpoint. Use realistic data and include expected responses.
```

**Maintaining consistency**:
```text wrap
Check if this new page follows our documentation standards and suggest any needed changes.
```
