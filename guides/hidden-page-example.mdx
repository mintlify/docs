This page is hidden! It is not included in the `docs.json` navigation so you can only access it by its URL.

See [Hidden pages](/guides/hidden-pages) for more information.

## Common use cases for hidden pages

<Note>
  All hidden pages are public, but not discoverable through the navigation. If you want to restrict access to a hidden page, you must configure [authentication](/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup).
</Note>

- **Beta documentation**: Information that can be public, but should not be discoverable through the navigation.
- **Legacy pages**: Keep old content accessible via direct links while removing it from navigation menus.
- **Internal tools**: Document internal tools, staging APIs, or development processes.
- **Context for AI tools**: Provide context for AI tools. Hidden pages must be indexed to be accessible to AI tools.

## Example: Internal API endpoint

```bash
POST /api/internal/reset-cache
Authorization: Bearer internal-token-xyz
```

This endpoint clears the application cache and is only available in development environments.

<Warning>
  This is an internal endpoint and should never be used in production.
