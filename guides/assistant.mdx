## About the assistant

The AI assistant answers questions about your documentation using natural language queries. When users ask a question, the assistant searches your content, cites relevant sources, and provides contextual answers.

The assistant uses agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with tool calling and runs on Claude Sonnet 4 by default. Users receive answers sourced exclusively from your documentation.

Monitor user interactions and export query data from your dashboard to gain insights into user needs and content gaps.

The assistant is automatically enabled for accounts on Pro, Growth, and Enterprise plans. See [Pricing](https://mintlify.com/pricing) for details.

## Using the assistant

There are two ways to access the assistant in your documentation:

- **Use the keyboard shortcut** <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Windows).
- **Select the assistant button** next to the search bar.

      className="block dark:hidden"
      alt="Search bar and assistant button in light mode."
    />

    <img
      src="/images/assistant/assistant-button-dark.png"
      className="hidden dark:block"
      alt="Search bar and assistant button in dark mode."
    />
  </Frame>

Both options open the assistant in the right side panel.

Ask any questions and the assistant will search your docs for an answer. If the assistant cannot find an answer in your documentation, it will respond that it cannot answer the question.

## Making content AI ingestible

To help the assistant provide accurate answers, structure your documentation with both human readers and AI tools in mind. Well-organized, thorough content makes it easier for the assistant to understand your documentation and deliver relevant responses to users.

### Structure and organization

- Write descriptive headings for sections.
- Create a logical information hierarchy with proper nesting (H1 \> H2 \> H3).
- Break up long blocks of text into shorter paragraphs.
- Use consistent formatting across your docs.

### Context

- Define specific terms and acronyms when first introduced.
- Provide sufficient conceptual content about features and procedures.
- Include examples and use cases.
- Cross-reference related topics.

### AI optimization

- Add hidden pages with additional context that users don't need, but the assistant can reference. See [Hidden pages](/guides/hidden-pages#ai-context) for more information.
- Use semantic markup.
- Include comprehensive metadata in page frontmatter.

## Exporting queries

You can review and export queries from your dashboard. Some ways that analyzing queries can help you improve your documentation:

- Identify content gaps for any queries that are frequent, but have insufficient responses or sources.
- Conduct lightweight user research by looking for themes and patterns in queries.
- See which pages are used as sources and prioritize them for accuracy and quality.

You can explore queries from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant), but to get more powerful insights we recommend exporting a `CSV` file of your queries, responses, and sources to analyze with your preferred AI tool.

1. Navigate to the [assistant page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant) in your dashboard.
2. Select **Export to CSV**.
3. Upload the queries into your AI tool and ask questions to learn about how your users are engaging with your docs. Some prompts to get you started:

- Summarize the most common themes of the queries.
- List any queries that had no sources cited.
