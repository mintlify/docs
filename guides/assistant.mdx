## About the assistant

The AI assistant answers questions about your documentation through natural language queries. When users ask a question, the assistant searches your content, cites relevant sources, and provides contextual answers sourced from your documentation.

The assistant uses agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with tool calling and runs on Claude Sonnet 4 by default.

You can monitor user interactions and export query data from your dashboard to gain insights into user needs and identify content gaps.

The assistant is automatically enabled for accounts on Pro, Growth, and Enterprise plans. See [Pricing](https://mintlify.com/pricing) for details.

## Using the assistant

Users can access the assistant in two ways:

- **Keyboard shortcut**: <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Windows)
- **Assistant button** next to the search bar
  <Frame>
    <img
      src="/images/assistant/assistant-button-light.png"
      className="block dark:hidden"
      alt="Search bar and assistant button in light mode."
    />
    <img
      src="/images/assistant/assistant-button-dark.png"
      className="hidden dark:block"
      alt="Search bar and assistant button in dark mode."
    />
  </Frame>

Both methods open a chat panel on the right side of your docs. Users can ask any question and the assistant will search your documentation for an answer. If no relevant information is found, the assistant will respond that it cannot answer the question.

## Making content AI ingestible

Structure your documentation to help the assistant provide accurate, relevant answers. Clear organization and comprehensive context benefit both human readers and AI understanding.

### Structure and organization

- Write descriptive headings for sections.
- Create a logical information hierarchy with proper nesting (H1 \> H2 \> H3).
- Break up long blocks of text into shorter paragraphs.
- Use consistent formatting across your docs.
- Use semantic markup.
- Include comprehensive metadata in page frontmatter.

### Context

- Define specific terms and acronyms when first introduced.
- Provide sufficient conceptual content about features and procedures.
- Include examples and use cases.
- Cross-reference related topics.
- Add [hidden pages](/guides/hidden-pages) with additional context that users don't need, but the assistant can reference.

## Exporting queries

You can review and export queries from your dashboard. Some ways that analyzing queries can help you improve your documentation:

- Identify content gaps for any queries that are frequent, but have insufficient responses or sources.
- Conduct lightweight user research by looking for themes and patterns in queries.
- See which pages are used as sources and prioritize them for accuracy and quality.

You can explore queries from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant), but to get more powerful insights we recommend exporting a `CSV` file of your queries, responses, and sources to analyze with your preferred AI tool.

1. Navigate to the [assistant page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant) in your dashboard.
2. Select **Export to CSV**.
3. Upload the queries into your AI tool and ask questions to learn about how your users are engaging with your docs. Some prompts to get you started:

- Summarize the most common themes of the queries.
- List any queries that had no sources cited.
