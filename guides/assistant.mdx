## About the assistant

The AI assistant answers questions about your documentation using natural language queries. When users ask a question, the assistant searches your content, cites relevant sources, and provides contextual answers.

The assistant uses agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with tool calling and runs on Claude Sonnet 4 by default. Users receive answers sourced exclusively from your documentation.

Monitor user interactions and export query data from your dashboard to gain insights into user needs and content gaps.

The assistant is automatically enabled for accounts on Pro, Growth, and Enterprise plans. See [Pricing](https://mintlify.com/pricing) for details.

## Using the assistant

There are two ways to access the assistant in your documentation:

- **Use the keyboard shortcut** <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Windows).
- **Select the assistant button** next to the search bar.

## Making content AI ingestible

To help the assistant provide accurate answers, structure your documentation with both human readers and AI tools in mind. Well-organized, thorough content makes it easier for the assistant to understand your documentation and deliver relevant responses to users.

### Structure and organization

- Write descriptive headings that indicate what setions are about.
- Create a logical information hierarchy with proper nesting (H1 \> H2 \> H3).
- Break up long blocks of text into shorter paragraphs.
- Use consistent formatting across your docs.

### Context

- Define specific terms and acronyms when first introduced.
- Provide sufficient conceptual content about features and procedures.
- Include examples and use cases.
- Cross-reference related topics.

### AI optimization

- Add hidden pages with additional context  that users don't need, but the assistant can reference.
- Use semantic markup.
- Include comprehensive metadata in pages' frontmatter.
