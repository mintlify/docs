Mintlify hosts your content as a website. Your content lives in a Git repository as MDX files, and Mintlify builds and deploys your site automatically when you push a change.

## The three parts of a Mintlify project

**Your repository** is the source of truth for your documentation. It contains an MDX file for every page and a `docs.json` file that configures your site's navigation, theme, and settings. You can use your own GitHub or GitLab repository, or let Mintlify create one for you during onboarding.

**The dashboard** connects to your repository and lets you manage your site. Use it to monitor deployments, configure settings, manage your team, and edit content directly in the browser.

**Your documentation site** is built from your repository and deployed at a `.mintlify.app` URL by default. When you're ready, you can point a custom domain to it.

## Editing content

There are two ways to edit your content, and you can switch between them freely.

- **Web editor**: Edit and publish pages in your browser. The editor commits changes back to your Git repository automatically.
- **CLI and local editor**: Clone your repository, run `mint dev` to preview your site locally, then push changes to deploy.

Multiple team members can work in either workflow at the same time, using Git branches to manage parallel changes. Anyone who can push to your repository can update your content.

## AI features

Built-in AI features help people and AI find and understand your content, and help you maintain your content.

The **assistant** lets your users ask questions and get cited answers from your content.

The **agent** helps your team create and maintain content by generating updates from scheduled workflows, pull requests merging in your feature repository, or Slack threads.

See [AI-native documentation](/ai-native) for an overview of all AI features.
