### Feedback

<Info>
  To collect and view feedback, you must first enable feedback from the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page in your dashboard.
</Info>

The Feedback section displays quantitative thumbs up and thumbs down votes your docs have received and any qualitative feedback that users have provided. You can use this information to discover user needs and make improvements to your docs.

If you have enabled **Thumbs rating** feedback, the Feedback section will display:

- **Liked by viewers**: Pages with the most positive feedback (thumbs up votes).
- **Needs improvement**: Pages with the most negative feedback (thumbs down votes).

If you have enabled **Contextual feedback** and **Code snippet** feedback, the Feedback section will display:

- **Context**: Feedback that users have provided for specific pages, including thumps up or down ratings, reasons for the ratings, and any additional comments.
- **Code**: Feedback that users have provided for specific code snippets.

For Context and Code feedback, you can select the status beside a piece of feedback to mark it as Pending, In Progress, Resolved, or Dismissed.
