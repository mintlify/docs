Improve your docs based on quantitative and qualitative data from your analytics dashboard.

## Cross-analytics insights

Combine information from multiple analytics sources to get a holistic view of your documentation.

### Correlate traffic and satisfaction
- High traffic + low feedback scores = Popular pages with a bad user experience. Prioritize fixing these pages. 
- Low traffic + high feedback scores = 
hidden gems worth promoting or expanding
- High traffic + high feedback scores = your documentation's greatest hits

### Match search intent with content performance
- High search volume + low page views = discoverability problem
- Popular search terms + low-confidence results = content gap opportunity
- Top searches + negative feedback on matching pages = content quality issue

### Identify user journey problems
- Popular referrer sources + high bounce rates = landing page mismatch
- Frequent searches + immediate negative feedback = users can't find what they need
- High code snippet feedback + low page ratings = implementation examples need work

### Find strategic opportunities
- Rising search trends + no existing popular pages = new content opportunities
- Declining traffic + stable positive feedback = promotion/SEO needed
- Consistent negative feedback across referrer sources = fundamental content issues

## Putting insights into action

Use these cross-analytics patterns to prioritize your documentation improvements:

- **Fix high-impact problems first**: Popular pages with poor feedback scores affect the most users
- **Fill verified content gaps**: Low-confidence searches with high volume indicate clear user needs
- **Promote hidden successes**: High-rated pages with low traffic deserve better discoverability
- **Align search and content**: Ensure your most-searched topics have comprehensive, well-organized pages
