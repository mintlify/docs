## Improving your docs with analytics

Use your analytics to enhance the user experience of your docs:

**Review popular content**: Ensure your most-visited pages contain current, accurate information and consider expanding successful topics.

**Address feedback concerns**: Investigate pages with negative feedback to identify and resolve user pain points.

**Optimize for search**: Review top search queries so that relevant pages are discoverable and up-to-date. Pay attention to low-confidence searches that might indicate content gaps.
