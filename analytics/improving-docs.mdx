Use your analytics data to enhance the user experience of your docs and identify improvement opportunities.

## Use overview metrics

**Review popular content**: Ensure your most-visited pages contain current, accurate information and consider expanding successful topics.

**Monitor traffic patterns**: Track changes in visitor counts and page views to understand the impact of updates or new content.

**Analyze referrer sources**: Understand how users find your docs to optimize external linking and SEO.

## Act on feedback data

**Address negative feedback**: Investigate pages with poor ratings to identify and resolve user pain points.

**Celebrate positive feedback**: Use highly-rated pages as examples of effective documentation patterns.

**Track feedback trends**: Monitor changes in satisfaction over time, especially after making updates.

## Optimize with search data

**Improve content discoverability**: Review top search queries to ensure relevant pages are easy to find and well-organized.

**Fill content gaps**: Pay attention to low-confidence searches that might indicate missing documentation or topics that need better coverage.

**Update popular content**: Ensure pages that match frequent search terms are current and comprehensive.
