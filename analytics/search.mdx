Use the data on the search tab to understand what users are searching for and identify topics that need to be updated or expanded.

Access your search metrics by navigating to the **Analytics** page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/analytics).

## Search metrics

Use the range selector to adjust the time period for displayed data.

- **Total queries**: Search volume
- **Top searches**: Most-searched terms
- **Low-confidence searches**: Queries that may not have returned relevant results

## Using search data

Review your search analytics to:

- **Identify popular topics**: Use top searches to understand what content people want to find.
- **Find content gaps**: Low-confidence searches may indicate missing documentation or topics that need better coverage.
- **Improve discoverability**: Ensure that pages matching popular search terms are easy to find and well-organized.
