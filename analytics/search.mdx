The Search tab shows search behavior on your docs site. Use this information to understand what users are searching for and find topics that need to be updated or added.

## Search metrics

- **Total queries**: Search volume
- **Top searches**: Most-searched terms
- **Low-confidence searches**: Queries that may not have found relevant results

## Using search data

Review your search analytics to:

- **Identify popular topics**: Use top searches to understand what content is most important to your users
- **Find content gaps**: Low-confidence searches may indicate missing documentation or topics that need better coverage
- **Improve discoverability**: Ensure that pages matching popular search terms are easy to find and well-organized
