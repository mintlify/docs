Each page is an MDX file, which combines Markdown content with React components to let you create rich, interactive documentation.

## Page metadata

Every page starts with frontmatter, the YAML metadata enclosed by `---` at the beginning of a file. This metadata defines how your page appears and behaves.

Use metadata to control:

- Page titles and descriptions
- Sidebar titles, icons, and tags

<ResponseField name="title" type="string" required>
  The title of your page that appears in navigation and browser tabs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A brief description of what this page covers. Appears under the title and improves SEO.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sidebarTitle" type="string">
  A short title that displays in the sidebar navigation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="icon" type="string">
  An icon next to your page title in the sidebar. Choose an icon from Font Awesome, Lucide, or use a custom URL. Configure your preferred icon library with the [icons library setting](/settings#param-icons).

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="string">
  A tag that appears next to your page title in the sidebar.
</ResponseField>

```yaml Example YAML frontmatter wrap
---
title: "About frontmatter"
description: "Frontmatter is the metadata that controls how your page appears and behaves"
sidebarTitle: "Frontmatter"
icon: "book"
tag: "NEW"
---
```

## Page mode

Control how your page displays with the `mode` setting.

### Default

If no mode is defined, defaults to a standard layout with a sidebar navigation and table of contents.

```yaml
---
title: "Default page title"
---
```

### Wide

Wide mode hides the table of contents. This is useful for pages that do not have any headings or if you prefer to use the extra horizontal space.

```yaml
---
title: "Wide page title"
mode: "wide"
---
```

### Custom

Custom mode provides a minimalist layout that removes all elements except for the top navbar. Custom mode is a blank canvas to create landing pages or any other unique layouts that you want to have minimal navigation elements for.

```yaml
---
title: "Custom page title"
mode: "custom"
---
```

### Center

Center mode removes the sidebar and table of contents, centering the content. This is useful for changelogs or other pages where you want to emphasize the content.

```yaml
---
title: "Center page title"
mode: "center"
---
```

## API pages

Create interactive API playgrounds by adding an API specification to your frontmatter, `api` or `openapi`.

```yaml
---
openapi: "GET /endpoint"
---
```

Learn more about building [API documentation](/api-playground/overview).

## External links

Link to external sites directly from your navigation with the `url` metadata.

```yaml
---
title: "npm Package"
url: "https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint"
---
```

## Search engine optimization

Most SEO meta tags are automatically generated. You can set SEO meta tags manually to improve your site's SEO, social sharing, and browser compatibility.

<Note>
  Meta tags with colons must be wrapped in quotes.
</Note>

```yaml
---
"twitter:image": "/images/social-preview.jpg"
---
```

See [SEO](/settings/seo) for complete SEO metadata options.

## Internal search keywords

Enhance a specific page's discoverability in the built-in search by providing `keywords` in your metadata. These keywords won't appear as part of the page content or in search results, but users that search for them will be shown the page as a result.

```yaml
---
keywords: ['configuration', 'setup', 'getting started']
---
```
