The overview tab shows how many people have visited your docs, what pages are most popular, and where users are coming from. Use this information to identify which pages are most valuable to your users and track trends over time.

Access the overview metrics by navigating to the **Analytics** page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/analytics).

## Metrics

Use the range selector to adjust the time period for displayed data. Select visitors, views, actions, or searches to display a line graph showing trends over the selected time period.

- **Visitors**: Unique visitors
- **Views**: Total page views
- **Actions**: Combined count of API calls, navbar link clicks, and CTA button clicks
- **Searches**: Total number of search queries performed in your documentation
- **Popular Pages**: Paths to the most-visited pages and their view counts
- **Referrers**: Top traffic sources directing users to your docs

## Search analytics

Search analytics shows what users are searching for in your documentation, helping you understand content gaps and user intent. The search metrics include:

- **Search query**: The exact terms users entered in the search bar
- **Hits**: Number of times the query was searched
- **CTR**: Click-through rate showing the percentage change compared to the previous period
- **Top clicked page**: The most frequently clicked result for each search query
- **Last searched**: Timestamp of the most recent search for that query

Use search analytics to:

- **Identify content gaps**: Discover what users are searching for but may not be finding easily
- **Optimize existing content**: See which pages users click on most frequently for specific queries
- **Track search trends**: Monitor changes in search behavior over time to understand evolving user needs
- **Improve discoverability**: Use high-volume search queries to inform your content structure and navigation

## Using overview data

Review your overview analytics to:

- **Identify popular pages**: Use popular pages to understand what content is most important to your users so that you can make sure it is up to date and comprehensive.
- **Track traffic trends**: Monitor changes in traffic to understand the impact of updates or new content.
