The overview tab shows how many people have visited your docs, what pages are most popular, and where users are coming from. Use this information to identify which pages are most valuable to your users and track trends over time.

Access the overview metrics by navigating to the **Analytics** page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/analytics).

## Metrics

Use the range selector to adjust the time period for displayed data. Select visitors, views, actions, or searches to display a line graph showing trends over the selected time period.

- **Visitors**: Unique visitors
- **Views**: Total page views
- **Actions**: Combined count of API calls, navbar link clicks, and CTA button clicks
- **Searches**: Total number of search queries performed in your documentation
- **Popular Pages**: Paths to the most-visited pages and their view counts
- **Referrers**: Top traffic sources directing users to your docs

## Search analytics

Search analytics help you understand what users are looking for in your documentation. The search metrics table displays detailed information about each search query:

- **Search query**: The exact terms users searched for
- **Hits**: Number of times this query was searched
- **CTR**: Click-through rate showing the percentage change compared to the previous period
- **Top clicked page**: The most frequently clicked result for this query
- **Last searched**: Timestamp of the most recent search for this query

Use search analytics to identify:

- **Content gaps**: Queries with low CTR may indicate missing or hard-to-find content
- **Popular topics**: High-volume searches reveal what matters most to your users
- **Navigation issues**: Searches for content that should be easily accessible may indicate navigation problems

## Using overview data

Review your overview analytics to:

- **Identify popular pages**: Use popular pages to understand what content is most important to your users so that you can make sure it is up to date and comprehensive.
- **Track traffic trends**: Monitor changes in traffic to understand the impact of updates or new content.
- **Optimize search results**: Review search analytics to improve content discoverability and address common user queries.
