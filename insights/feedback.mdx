<Info>
  To collect and view feedback, you must first enable feedback from the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page in your dashboard.
</Info>

The feedback tab displays quantitative thumbs up and thumbs down votes your docs have received and any qualitative feedback that users have provided. Use this information to gauge the quality of your docs and make improvements.

Access the feedback tab by navigating to the **Insights** page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/insights).

## Feedback types

<Note>
  Contextual and code snippet feedback are in beta. To enable them for your documentation site, [contact our sales team](mailto:hahnbee@mintlify.com). 
</Note>

The feedback tab displays information according to the feedback add-ons that you enable.

Enable your preferred feedback types:

* **Thumbs rating only**: Simple thumbs up/down voting to gauge overall satisfaction with pages.
* **Code snippet feedback only**: Feedback specifically on code snippets.
* **Thumbs rating and contextual feedback**: Page voting plus detailed comments and reasons for ratings.
* **Thumbs rating and code snippet feedback**: Page voting plus feedback on code examples.
* **Thumbs rating, contextual, and code snippet feedback**: Complete feedback system with page voting, detailed comments, and code snippet feedback.

<Note>
  If you disable telemetry in your `docs.json` file, feedback features will not appear on your documentation pages, even if you enable them in your dashboard.

## Collect feedback from logged-out visitors

If you use [partial authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup#partial-authentication), you can gather feedback from people who are browsing public pages without signing in.

1. Enable the feedback add-ons you want to expose (thumbs, contextual, or code snippet) from the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page.
2. Configure partial authentication so the pages you want feedback on remain public.
3. Keep the feedback components visible in your theme. Visitors who are not logged in see the same controls and can submit ratings or comments.

Submissions from logged-out visitors are stored the same way as authenticated feedback and appear in the **Feedback** tab with an anonymous user label. Fully private deployments still require users to authenticate before they can leave feedback.

## Managing feedback

For contextual and code snippet feedback, you can set the status of a piece of feedback and add internal notes to track your work resolving user feedback.

### Changing feedback status

Select the status beside a piece of feedback to mark it as **Pending**, **In Progress**, **Resolved**, or **Dismissed**.

Best practices for setting feedback statuses:

* **Pending**: Feedback is awaiting review.
* **In Progress**: Feedback has been validated and is being worked on.
* **Resolved**: Feedback has been resolved.
* **Dismissed**: Feedback has been dismissed as not actionable, irrelevant, or inaccurate.

### Filtering by status

Use the status filter to control which feedback is displayed. Clear a status to hide all feedback with that status. By default, all feedback is displayed.

### Adding internal notes

Click on a piece of feedback to add an internal note. These notes are only visible to people with access to your dashboard.

Use notes to add information for collaboration, link relevant support or engineering tickets, or remember any other useful information.

## Using feedback data

Review your feedback data to:

  * **Identify successful content**: Pages with the most positive feedback show what works well in your documentation.
  * **Prioritize improvements**: Pages with the most negative feedback indicate what content might need attention.
  * **Take action**: Make documentation updates based on direct user feedback.
