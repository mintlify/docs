<Info>
  To collect and view feedback, you must first enable feedback from the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page in your dashboard.
</Info>

The feedback tab displays quantitative thumbs up and thumbs down votes your docs have received and any qualitative feedback that users have provided. Use this information to gauge the quality of your docs and make improvements.

Access the feedback tab by navigating to the **Insights** page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/insights).

## Feedback types

<Note>
  Contextual and code snippet feedback are in beta. To enable them for your documentation site, [contact our sales team](mailto:hahnbee@mintlify.com). 
</Note>

The feedback tab displays information according to the feedback add-ons that you enable.

Enable your preferred feedback types:

## Managing feedback

For contextual and code snippet feedback, you can set the status of a piece of feedback and add internal notes to track your work resolving user feedback.

### Changing feedback status

Select the status beside a piece of feedback to mark it as **Pending**, **In Progress**, **Resolved**, or **Dismissed**.

Best practices for setting feedback statuses:

* **Pending**: Feedback is awaiting review.
* **In Progress**: Feedback has been validated and is being worked on.
* **Resolved**: Feedback has been resolved.
* **Dismissed**: Feedback has been dismissed as not actionable, irrelevant, or inaccurate.

### Filtering by status

Use the status filter to control which feedback is displayed. Clear a status to hide all feedback with that status. By default, all feedback is displayed.

### Adding internal notes

Click on a piece of feedback to add an internal note. These notes are only visible to people with access to your dashboard.

Use notes to add information for collaboration, link relevant support or engineering tickets, or remember any other useful information.

## Using feedback data

Review your feedback data to:

  * **Identify successful content**: Pages with the most positive feedback show what works well in your documentation.
  * **Prioritize improvements**: Pages with the most negative feedback indicate what content might need attention.
  * **Take action**: Make documentation updates based on direct user feedback.
