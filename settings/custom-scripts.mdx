Add custom CSS & JS to your documentation to fully customize the look and feel.

## Custom CSS

Add any number of CSS files to your repository and the defined class names will be applied and available across all of your MDX files.

### Adding style.css

For example, you can add the following `style.css` file to customize the styling of the navbar and footer.

```css
#navbar {
  background: "#fffff2";
  padding: 1rem;
}

footer {
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
```

### Using Identifiers

Mintlify has a set of common identifiers to help you tag important elements of the UI. Some, but not all are listed in the following:

`#topbar-cta-button` `#navbar` `#sidebar` `#content-area` `#table-of-contents`

<Tip>
  Use inspect element to find references to elements you're looking to
  customize.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  References and the styling of common elements are subject to change as the
  platform evolves. Please use custom styling with caution.
</Warning>

## Custom JS

Custom JS allows you to add custom executable code globally. It is the equivalent of adding a `<script>` tag with JS code into every page.

### Adding Custom JavaScript

Any `.js` file inside the content directory of your docs will be included in every documentation page. For example, you can add the following `ga.js` file to enable [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics) across the entire documentation.

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag() {
  dataLayer.push(arguments);
}
gtag('js', new Date());

gtag('config', 'TAG_ID');
```
