All documentation pages are auto-hosted in a variety of markdown formats to make it easier for:

- End users to feed your docs into large language models (LLMs) for specific information retrieval
- LLMs to efficiently index your content without parsing HTML or JavaScript

## Supported formats

We support industry standards such as [/llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) as well as additional markdown formats.

- **/llms.txt**: A markdown file of a structured index of your docs is automatically hosted at /llms.txt. Helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently (e.g. a sitemap for AI).
- **/llms-full.txt**: A markdown file of all your docs content is automatically hosted at /llms-full.txt. Helps users load complete context into AI tools in one link.
- **.md support**: Add .md to an individual docs page to see a markdown version of that page. Helps load individual pages into AI tools with better token efficiency & inference time.
- **âŒ˜ \+ c shortcut**: Copy markdown source of any page using command \+ c.
