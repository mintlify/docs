All documentation pages are auto-hosted in a variety of markdown formats to make it easier for:
- End users to feed your docs into large language models (LLMs) for specific information retrieval
- LLMs to efficiently index your content without parsing HTML, ads, or JavaScript

## Supported formats
We support industry standards such as [/llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org) as well as additional markdown formats. 
- **/llms.txt**: Append /llms.txt to your documentation to see a structured index. Helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently (e.g. a sitemap for AI).
- **/llms-full.txt**: Append /llms-full.txt to your docs URL to see a single markdown file of all your docs content. Helps users load complete context into AI tools in one link.
- **.md support**: Append .md to an individual docs page to see a markdown version of that page. Helps load individual pages into AI tools with better token efficiency & inference time.
- **âŒ˜ + c shortcut**: Copy markdown source of any page using command + c.
