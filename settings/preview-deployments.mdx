Preview deployments let you see how changes to your docs will look before merging to production. Each preview creates a shareable URL that updates automatically as you push new changes.

## Creating preview deployments

Preview deployments are created automatically through pull requests or manually from your dashboard.

### Automatic previews

When you create a pull request, the Mintlify bot automatically adds a link to view the preview deployment in your pull request. The preview updates each time you push new commits to the branch.

## Sharing preview deployments

Preview deployments can be publicly accessible or restricted to authenticated users.

**Public access**: Preview URLs are publicly viewable by default. Share a preview link with anyone who needs to review your changes.

**Restricted access**: Enable deployment authentication to limit preview access to authenticated Mintlify users only. [Contact sales](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) to set up authentication for your previews.
