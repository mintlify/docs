</Info>

Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your docs in a live deployment without merging those changes to your production branch.

If you have created a pull or merge request when using Git, the generated preview URL will be available as a comment from the Mintlify bot in the PR. This URL will always reflect the latest deployment changes.

## Sharing Preview Deployments

After generating a preview URL, you can share that link with anybody for them to view.

### Authenticated Preview Deployments

If you'd like to restrict access to your Preview Deployments, you can set up preview deployment authentication. When using this authentication method, only Mintlify authenticated users will be able to access your Preview Deployments.

To set up preview deployment authentication, please [contact sales](mailto:sales@mintlify.com).
