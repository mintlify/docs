<Info>
  Preview deployments are available on [Growth and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=preview-deployments).
</Info>

Preview deployments let you see how changes to your docs will look before merging to production. Each preview creates a shareable URL that updates automatically as you push new changes.

## Creating preview deployments

Preview deployments are created automatically through pull requests or manually from your dashboard.

### Automatic previews

When you create a pull request, the Mintlify bot automatically adds a link to view the preview deployment in your pull request. The preview updates each time you push new commits to the branch.

### Manual previews

You can manually create a preview for any branch if you are on a Growth or Enterprise plan or have the preview deployment add-on.

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).
2. Select **Previews**.
3. Select **Create preview**.
4. Enter your branch name.
5. Select **Create deployment**.

## Redeploying a preview

Redeploy a preview to refresh content or retry after a failed deployment.

1. Select the preview from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).
2. Select **Redeploy**.

## Sharing preview deployments

Preview deployments can be publicly accessible or restricted to authenticated users.

**Public access**: Preview URLs are publicly viewable by default. Share a preview link with anyone who needs to review your changes.

**Restricted access**: Enable preview deployment authentication to limit preview access to authenticated Mintlify users only. See [Authentication Setup](/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup) for more information.
