Mintlify uses a GitHub App to automatically sync your documentation with your GitHub repository.

## Installation

Install the Mintlify GitHub App on the GitHub account or organization that owns your docs repository. Installing a GitHub App requires either
organization ownership or admin permissions in a repository. If you lack the necessary permissions, the repository owner will need to approve the request.

You can install the Mintlify GitHub App through your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

We recommend granting access only to the repository where your docs are hosted.

## Permissions

When you install the GitHub app, you will be prompted to grant the following permissions:

- **Read** access to `metadata`
- **Read** and **write** access to `checks`, `code`, `deployments`, `pull requests`,
  and `workflows`

These permissions are leveraged to provide a seamless experience when managing
your docs.

When you make a commit to the branch you configured as your docs deployment
branch, we fetch the contents of the files changed to update your docs. To
accomplish this we need read access to your `contents`.

When pull requests are created we create a check and preview deployment which is
why we need write access to `checks` and `deployments`.

Inside the Mintlify web editor, Mintlify works on your behalf to create branches
and pull requests which is why we need write access to `pull requests` and
`workflows`.

<Info>
  If you are concerned about the write permissions, the GitHub App will only
  have access to the repos you give it access to _and_ if you have branch
  protections on it _cannot_ push directly to your branches - it abides by your
  branch protection rules.

## Repositories Installations

When installing our GitHub app, you will be prompted to select all repositories
or a subset of them. This selection can be changed at any time by going to the
[GitHub app settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems with the GitHub app, resetting the connection can solve most problems.
