## Setup

Add `"versions": ["v2", "v1"]` to your `mint.json` file where "v1" and "v2" are the names of your versions. You can put any number of versions in this array.

<Tip>
  The versions dropdown will show your versions in the order you include them in
  `mint.json`.
</Tip>

## Versioning Options

You can add version values to anchors, groups, or individual pages.

### Anchors

You can hide an entire anchor based on a version. This is useful when you have dozens of pages you want to hide. For example, for an API reference section.

Simply add `version` to your anchor. Anchors without a version value are shown in every version.

```json mint.json
"anchors": [
    {
        "name": "API Reference V1",
        "url": "v1/api-reference",
        "version": "v1"
    },
    {
        "name": "API Reference V2",
        "url": "v2/api-reference",
        "version": "v2"
    },
    {
        "name": "Anchor Without a Version",
        "url": "example-anchor"
    }
]
```

You don't need to add `v1/` or `v2/` to the start of your URLs, but some customers do it to keep their doc files organized.

### Groups

You can version specific groups. This is useful when a few pages changed but everything else stayed the same.

Simply add `version` to your groups. Groups without a version value are shown in every version.

In the example below, pages in `Nested Group V1` only show up when `v1` docs are shown.

```json mint.json
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Group without a version",
        "pages": [
            {
                "group": "Nested Group V1",
                "pages": ["page-with-version", "other-page-with-version"],
                "version": "v1"
            },
            {
                "group": "Nested Group Always Shows",
                "pages": ["nested-page", "other-nested-page"],
            },
            "page"
        ]
    }
]
```

### Pages

You can version a single page. Add `version` to the top of your page metadata like so:

```md page.mdx
---
title: "My page title"
description: "My page description"
version: "v1"
---
```

Your navigation config in `mint.json` should include the page like normal, but the page will only show up when the correct version is selected.

### Reusable Pages

Not _all_ content has to be hidden though! Any content without a version value shows up in every version so you never duplicate content!

## Troubleshooting

Common errors and how to fix them

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Pages Show Up In Wrong Version" icon="circle-exclamation">
You likely nested a version inside of another. For example, your group had version "v1" but your page had version "v2".

We do not recommend nesting versions inside of each other because it's hard to maintain your docs later.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Pages" icon="circle-exclamation">
  If you add versions to your docs and the pages disappeared from your
  navigation, make sure you spelled the version the same as in your `versions`
  array in `mint.json`.
