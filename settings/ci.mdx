<Warning>
  This feature is only available for customers on paid plans and for GitHub. Support for other platforms is coming soon.
</Warning>

Use CI checks to lint your docs for errors, and give you warnings before you deploy.

## Installation

To begin, you will need to have followed the steps on the [GitHub](/settings/github) page.

For GitHub Apps, you can choose to only give permissions to a single repository.
We highly recommend you do so as we only need access to the repository where
your docs are hosted.

## Configuration

You can configure the CI checks enabled for a deployment on the Mintlify dashboard by navigating to the 'Add-Ons' tab. There you can enable or disable the checks you'd like to run.

When enabling checks, you can choose to run them at a `Warning` or `Blocking` level.

<Note>


A `Blocking` level check will provide a failure status if not passed, or changes are suggested.<br/>

A `Warning` level check will never provide a failure status, even if there is an error or suggestions.

</Note>

## When Do They Run?

CI checks are configured to run on commits to your configured deployment branch, or on pull requests against that branch.

## Available CI Checks

### Broken Links

Similarly to how the [CLI link checker](/settings/broken-links#broken-links) works on your local machine, we will automatically check your docs for broken links.
To see the results of this check, you can visit GitHub's check results page for a specific commit.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open-source rule-based prose linter which supports a range of document types, including Markdown and MDX.

Mintlify supports automatically running Vale in a CI check, and displaying the results as a check status.

#### Configuration
If you have a `.vale.ini` file in the root the content directory for your deployment, we will automatically use that configuration file.
We will also automatically use any configuration files in your specified `stylesPath`.

<Tip>Don't have a Vale config or not sure where to get started? Don't worry, Mintlify has a default configuration that will automatically be used if one is not provided.</Tip>

<Warning>
Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support any absolute `stylesPath`, or `stylesPath` which include `..` values. Please use relative paths and include the `stylesPath` in your repository.
</Warning>

#### Packages
Vale supports a range of [packages](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/packages), which can be used to check for spelling and style errors.
Any packages you include in your repository under the correct `stylesPath` will be automatically installed and used in your Vale configuration.

For packages not included in your repository, you may specify any packages from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer), and they will automatically be downloaded and used in your Vale configuration.

<Warning>
Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support automatically downloading packages that are not from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer).
</Warning>

#### Vale with MDX
Vale does not natively support MDX, but Vale's author has provided a [custom extension](https://github.com/errata-ai/MDX) to support it.

If you'd prefer not to use this extension, we recommend the following lines in your `.vale.ini` file:
```ini
[formats]
mdx = md

[*.mdx]
CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}

TokenIgnores = (?sm)((?:import|export) .+?$), \
(?<!`)(<\w+ ?.+ ?\/>)(?!`), \
(<[A-Z]\w+>.+?<\/[A-Z]\w+>)

BlockIgnores = (?sm)^(<\w+\n .*\s\/>)$, \
(?sm)^({.+.*})
```

To use Vale's in-document comments, use MDX-style comments `{/* ... */}`.
If you use the `CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}` [setting](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/commentdelimiters) in your configuration, Vale will automatically interpret these comments while linting.
This means you can easily use Vale's in-built features, like skipping lines or sections.

```mdx
{/* vale off */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* vale on */}
```


If you choose not to use `CommentDelimiters`, but still choose to use Vale's comments, you must wrap any Vale comments in MDX comments `{/* ... */}`. For example:

```mdx
{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}
```
Please note that these commment tags are not supported within Mintlify components, but can be used anywhere at the base level of a document.
