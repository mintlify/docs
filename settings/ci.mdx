<Info>
  [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=docs-ci) include CI checks for GitHub repositories.
</Info>

Use CI checks to lint your docs for errors and provide warnings before you deploy. CI checks are configured to run on commits to your configured deployment branch, or on pull requests against that branch.

## Installation

To begin, follow the steps on the [GitHub](/settings/github) page.

For GitHub Apps, you can choose to give permissions to only a single repository. We highly recommend you do so as we only need access to the repository where your docs are hosted.

## Configuration

Configure the CI checks enabled for a deployment by navigating to the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard. Enable the checks that you want to run.

When enabling checks, you can choose to run them at a `Warning` or `Blocking` level.

- A `Warning` level check will never provide a failure status, even if there is an error or suggestions.
- A `Blocking` level check will provide a failure status if not passed, or changes are suggested.

## Available CI checks

### Broken links

Similar to how the [CLI link checker](/settings/broken-links#broken-links) works on your local machine, we automatically check your docs for broken links.

To see the results of this check, visit GitHub's check results page for a specific commit.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open-source rule-based prose linter which supports a range of document types, including Markdown and MDX.

Mintlify supports automatically running Vale in a CI check and displaying the results as a check status.

#### Configuration
If you have a `.vale.ini` file in the root content directory for your deployment, we automatically use that configuration file. We also automatically use any configuration files in your specified `stylesPath`.

If you do not have a Vale config file, the default configuration automatically loads.

<Warning>
Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support any absolute `stylesPath`, or `stylesPath` which include `..` values. Please use relative paths and include the `stylesPath` in your repository.
</Warning>

#### Packages
Vale supports a range of [packages](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/packages), which can be used to check for spelling and style errors.
Any packages you include in your repository under the correct `stylesPath` are automatically installed and used in your Vale configuration.

For packages not included in your repository, you may specify any packages from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer), and they are automatically downloaded and used in your Vale configuration.

<Warning>
Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support automatically downloading packages that are not from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer).
</Warning>

#### Vale with `MDX`
Vale does not natively support `MDX`, but Vale's author has provided a [custom extension](https://github.com/errata-ai/MDX) to support it.

If you prefer not to use this extension, we recommend the following lines in your `.vale.ini` file:
```ini
[formats]
mdx = md

[*.mdx]
CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}

TokenIgnores = (?sm)((?:import|export) .+?$), \
(?<!`)(<\w+ ?.+ ?\/>)(?!`), \
(<[A-Z]\w+>.+?<\/[A-Z]\w+>)

BlockIgnores = (?sm)^(<\w+\n .*\s\/>)$, \
(?sm)^({.+.*})
```

To use Vale's in-document comments, use MDX-style comments `{/* ... */}`. If you use the `CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}` [setting](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/commentdelimiters) in your configuration, Vale automatically interprets these comments while linting. This means you can easily use Vale's built-in features, like skipping lines or sections.

```mdx
{/* vale off */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* vale on */}
```


If you choose not to use `CommentDelimiters` but still choose to use Vale's comments, you must wrap any Vale comments in MDX comments `{/* ... */}`. For example:

```mdx
{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}
```
These comment tags are not supported within Mintlify components but can be used anywhere at the base level of a document.
