You can customize your 404 "Page not found" error page to provide a better user experience when visitors encounter broken or missing links.

## Configuration

Configure your custom 404 page in the `errors.404` section of your `docs.json` file:

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "404": {
      "redirect": false,
      "title": "I can't be found",
      "description": "What ever **happened** to this _page_?"
    }
  }
}
```

### Parameters

<ResponseField name="redirect" type="boolean">
  Whether to automatically redirect to the home page when a page is not found. Set to `false` to show the custom 404 page instead.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="title" type="string">
  Custom title for the 404 error page. This replaces the default "Page not found" heading.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  Custom description for the 404 error page. Supports Markdown formatting for styling text with **bold**, _italic_, and other formatting options.
</ResponseField>

## Example

Here's a complete example showing how to set up a custom 404 page:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://mintlify.com/docs.json",
  "name": "My Documentation",
  "theme": "mint",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#3B82F6"
  },
  "navigation": {
    "pages": ["index", "quickstart"]
  },
  "errors": {
    "404": {
      "redirect": false,
      "title": "Oops! Page not found",
      "description": "The page you're looking for doesn't exist. Try checking the URL or **[return to our homepage](/)** to find what you need."
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration will:
- Show a custom 404 page instead of redirecting to the homepage
- Display "Oops! Page not found" as the title
- Show a helpful description with a link back to the homepage

## Best practices

- Keep your title concise and friendly
- Use the description to guide users to helpful resources
- Include links to your homepage or popular pages in the description
- Use Markdown formatting to make important information stand out
