## Tabs

Tabs help distinguish between different topics or sections of your documentation. They show up above the main sidebar.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/tabs-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/tabs-dark.png" />
</Frame>

Configure tabs with the `tabs` field of the `mint.json` file. The `url` field of the tab object should map to a folder of content added to your sidebar, or an external link.

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "name": "API References",
        "url": "api-references"
    },
    {
        "name": "Content",
        "url": "content"
    }
]
```

To configure the default `Documentation` primary tab, add the `primaryTab` field to your `mint.json` file with your desired name. Any files in your navigation not in a folder reserved by another tab will show up in the primary tab.

```json
"primaryTab": {
    "name": "Home"
}
```

## Anchors

Anchors provide another way to direct users to sections of your documentation, or link out to external URLs.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/anchor-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/anchor-dark.png" />
</Frame>

Configure anchors with the `anchors` field of the `mint.json` file. The `url` field of the tab object should map an external link, or a folder of content added to your sidebar. More fields for anchors can be found [here](/settings/global).

```json
"anchors": [
    {
        "name": "API References",
        "icon": "code",
        "url": "api-references"
    },
    {
        "name": "Content",
        "icon": "pencil",
        "url": "content"
    },
    {
        "name": "Contact us",
        "icon": "envelope",
        "url": "https://mintlify.com/contact-us"
    }
]
```

To configure the default `Documentation` top anchor, add the `topAnchor` field to your `mint.json`. Note: The default top anchor does not show.

```json
"topAnchor": {
    "name": "Home",
    "icon": "building",
    "url": "home"
}
```

## Sidebar

Our sidebar navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<Info>
  Once you add a page to your docs directory, you'll need to add the path to
  `mint.json` to add it to the sidebar. Pages do not show up automatically.

<CodeGroup>

```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```

```json Nested Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": [
            "quickstart",
            {
                "group": "Nested Reference Pages",
                "pages": ["nested-reference-page"]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

</CodeGroup>

### Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `mint.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>

You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.

</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Group Name",
        "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
    }
]
```

### Hidden Pages

MDX files not included in `mint.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.
