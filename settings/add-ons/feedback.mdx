Mintlify supports a range of [feedback](#feedback) and [analytics tools](/integrations/analytics) to help you improve your documentation.

Alongside third party integrations, Mintlify maintains features to help you collect feedback and build analytics on your docs.

### Feedback
You can enable feedback collection on your docs in three ways:

1. **Thumbs Rating**: Allow users to rate your docs with a thumbs up or down. This is useful for gauging user satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement
2. **Edit Suggestion**: Allow users to suggest edits to your docs. These edits are presented in your version control system (e.g. GitHub) as a pull request. This feature is only available on documentation which uses a public repository
3. **Raise Issues**: Allow users to raise issues with your docs. This is useful for users to report bugs, inconsistencies, or to raise accessibility concerns

### Analytics
Mintlify automatically collects analytics on your docs to help you understand how users are interacting with your docs. This includes:

- Any feedback you've chosen to collect
- Unique visitors
- Page views
- Actions taken on page
- Source\(s\) of traffic
- Your most popular pages
- Popular search queries

These analytics are available in the 'Analytics' tab in your dashboard.

### Privacy & Compliance
Built-in analytics can be disabled at any time using [data privacy integrations](/integrations/privacy/overview) for compliance purposes.
