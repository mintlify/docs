When you change the path of a file in your docs folder, it will also change the path of the URL to that page. This may happen when restructuring your docs or changing the sidebar title.

## Broken Links

Catch broken links with our CLI. Simply [install the CLI](/development) and run the command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

The CLI will identify any relative links in your docs that don't exist.

## Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field into your `mint.json` file.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/source/path",
    "destination": "/destination/path"
  }
]
```

This will permanently redirect `/source/path` to `/destination/path` so that you don't lose any previous SEO for the original page.

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` will match `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/beta/:slug*",
    "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
  }
]
```
