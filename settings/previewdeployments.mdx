</Info>

Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your app in a live deployment without merging those changes to your Git project's production branch.

If you have created a pull or merge request when using Git, the generated preview URL will be available as a comment from the Mintlify bot in the body of the PR. This URL will always reflect the latest deployment changes.

## Sharing Preview Deployments

After generated a preview URL, you can share that link with anybody for them to view.

If you'd like to restrict access, you can use [authentication via Mintlify handshake](./authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/mintlify) to make preview deployments private by default. When using this authentication method, only Mintlify authenticated users will be able to access your Preview Deployments.
