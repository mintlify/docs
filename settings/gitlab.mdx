<Check>
  GitLab integration is available on the [Enterprise
  plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing).
</Check>

We use a combination of Access tokens and Webhooks to authenticate and sync
changes between GitLab and Mintlify.

- We use Access tokens to pull information from GitLab.
- We use Webhooks so GitLab can notify Mintlify when changes are made.
  - This allows Mintlify to create preview deployments when a MR is created.

## Set up the connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your project ID">
    Within your GitLab project, navigate to `Settings` > `General` and find the `Project ID`.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-project-id.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an access token">
    a. Navigate to `Settings` > `Access Tokens`.

    b. Select `Add new token`.
      1. Name the token "Mintlify".
      2. If you have a private repo, you must set the role as `Maintainer`.
      3. Choose `api` and `read_api` for the scopes.

    c. Finally click `Create project access token` and copy the token.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the connection">
    Within the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/mintlify/mintlify/settings/deployment/git-settings), add the project ID and access token from the previous steps alongside the other configurations. Click "Save Changes" when you're done.

## Create the webhook

Webhooks allow us to receive events when changes are made so that we can
automatically trigger deployments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings > Webhooks and click 'Add new Webhook'">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-webhook.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up URL and webhook">
    In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint `https://leaves.mintlify.com/gitlab-webhook` and name the webhook "Mintlify".

  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste token">
    Paste the Webhook token generated after setting up the connection.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-show-webtoken.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select events">
    Select the events you want to trigger the webhook:
      - Push events (All branches)
      - Merge requests events
      
    When you're done it should look like this:
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-project-webtoken.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Webhook">
    After creating the Webhook, click the "Test" dropdown and select "Push events" to send a sample payload to ensure it's configured correctly. It'll say "Hook executed successfully: HTTP 200" if configured correctly.

    This will help you verify that everything is working correctly and that your documentation will sync properly with your GitLab repository.
