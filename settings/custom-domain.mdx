To set up your documentation on a custom subdomain, you'll need to set your desired custom subdomain in your Mintlify settings and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a custom subdirectory domain like mintlify.com/docs? Find
  instructions [here](/advanced/subpath/cloudflare).

## Dashboard Settings

1. Head over to your [dashboard project](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Click on the "Add custom subdomain".
3. Enter your desired custom subdomain. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`.

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-light.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Verification with Vercel

If Vercel happens to be your domain provider, you will have to add a verification `TXT` record. This information will show on your dashboard after submitting your custom subdomain, as well as be emailed to you.

## Configuring your DNS

1. Proceed to your domain's DNS settings on your domain provider.
2. Create a new DNS entry, inputting the following values:

```
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com
```

<Frame>
  <img alt="DNS" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/mintlify-dns.png" />
</Frame>

If you are using Cloudflare for your DNS provider, you'll need to have the “full strict” security option enabled for the https setting.

Please [contact support](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) if you don't see the custom subdomain set up after the above configuration.
