To set up your documentation on a custom domain, you'll need to set your desired custom domain in your Mintlify settings and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a custom subdirectory like `mintlify.com/docs`? See the [custom subdirectory](/advanced/subpath/cloudflare) docs.

## Dashboard settings

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Select **Settings**
3. Select **Domain Setup**
4. Enter your desired custom domain. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-light.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Configuring your DNS

1. Proceed to your domain's DNS settings on your domain provider's website.
2. Create a new DNS entry, inputting the following values:

```bash
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com.
```

## Provider-specific settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vercel verification">
    If Vercel is your domain provider, you must add a verification `TXT` record. This information will show on your dashboard after submitting your custom domain, as well as be emailed to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cloudflare security settings">
    If Cloudflare is your DNS provider, you must enable the "full strict" security option for the https setting.
