description: "Guarantee privacy of your docs by authenticating users"

Authentication offers full privacy for all of your
documentation content by requiring users to authenticate before viewing any content, such as:

- Documentation page content
- Images used in documentation pages
- Search results
- AI chat interactions

You can authenticate users through handshake methods such as:

- [Password](./authentication-setup/password)
- [JWT](./authentication-setup/jwt)
- [OAuth](./authentication-setup/oauth)
- [Mintlify dashboard](./authentication-setup/mintlify)

Authentication is similar to our [Personalization](./personalization) offering, but with guaranteed privacy. In addition
to securing your documentation content, all features that are available via
Personalization are also available via Authentication.

Check out our docs for more info on [choosing Authentication vs Personalization](./authentication-vs-personalization).
