As the name suggests, Authentication offers full privacy for all of your
documentation content. This includes all of the following:

- Documentation page content
- Images used in documentation pages
- Search results
- AI chat interactions

Authentication can be thought of as Personalization + privacy. In addition
to securing your documentation content, all features that are available via
Personalization are also available via Authentication. For more information
about the features of Personalization, [visit our docs on Personalization](./personalization).
