title: 'Choosing a Handshake'
description: 'How to decide which Handshake method is right for your docs'
---

<Info>
  This is the documentation for **Authentication** Handshake methods. Personalization offers a [different set of Handshake methods](/settings/authentication-personalization/personalization-setup/choosing-a-handshake).
</Info>

Before your users can access personalized content, they must be authenticated. Mintlify supports four Authentication Handshake methods:

1. **Password**: Configure a set of global passwords for your documentation site.
2. **JWT**: Use your own login flow to authenticate your users via a JWT in the URL.
3. **OAuth 2.0**: Integrate with your OAuth server to enable user login via the standard Authorization Code flow.
4. **Mintlify Dashboard**: Allow all of your dashboard users to access your docs, zero configuration required.

## Prerequisites

  <Tab title="Password">

    - Your security requirements allow for password sharing between documentation readers.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JWT">

    - You have some existing login flow.
    - You can add a final step in this login flow that creates a JWT and redirects to the docs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">

    - You have an existing OAuth server that supports the Authorization Code flow.
    - You can create a new API endpoint that can be accessed by the returned OAuth access token.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mintlify Dashboard">

    - Your documentation readers are also your documentation editors.
