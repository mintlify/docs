title: "Mintlify Dashboard Handshake"
description: "Use Mintlify to authenticate users"
---

<Info>
  The Mintlify Dashboard Handshake is available only for Authentication, *not*
  Personalization.
</Info>

You can use Mintlify to authenticate and manage access to your documentation. Anyone that can access your dashboard will automatically be able to see your documentation.

This handshake method also enables private preview deployments, so that only Mintlify authenticated users will be able to access your preview deployments.

<Note>
  Authentication is available only by request. Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for access. After we've
  enabled access, you can follow the implementation instructions.
</Note>

### Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I want my docs
to be internal, and the people that will be viewing my docs are the same people that
contribute to my docs.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I can go to my [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication)
and enable Authentication with the Mintlify Dashboard Handshake.

I can then ensure that anyone that should be able to read the docs has been added as a user in
my [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and select
    the Mintlify Auth Handshake.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add users">
    Ensure that any users that should be able to view your documentation have
    been added as users in your [Mintlify dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
