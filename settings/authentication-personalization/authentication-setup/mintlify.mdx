title: 'Mintlify Dashboard Handshake'
description: 'Use the Mintlify Dashboard to authenticate users'
---

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the Mintlify Dashboard **Authentication** Handshake. The Mintlify Dashboard Handshake is not available for Personalization.
</Info>

If your documentation readers are also your documentation editors, you can allow Mintlify to manage access to your documentation. Anyone that can access
your dashboard will automatically be able to access your documentation.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your Authentication settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and enable the Mintlify Dashboard Handshake.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add users">
    Ensure that any users that should be able to view your documentation have been added as users in your
    [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I want my docs
to be internal, and the people that will be viewing my docs are the same people that
contribute to my docs.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication)
and enable Authentication with the Mintlify Dashboard Handshake.

I then ensure that anyone that should be able to read the docs has been added as a user in
my [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
