<Info>
  This is the documentation for the Password **Authentication** Handshake. The
  Password Handshake is not available for Personalization.
</Info>

If you don't have strict security requirements, or you don't want to manage a
database of documentation readers, you can use a set of shared passwords to
protect your docs.

<Note>
  Authentication is available only by request. Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a> for access.
  After we've enabled access, you can follow the implementation instructions.
</Note>

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a password">
    Go to your [dashboard
    settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and create
    a password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share your password">
    Securely share the password with your documentation readers. That's it!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I don't want
to have to keep track of who can and cannot access the docs. My main use case for
authentication is to prevent competitors from snooping - password sharing is secure
enough for my team.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my Mintlify dashboard and add at
least one password. I then share that password, along with the private docs URL,
with potential customers.
