Mintlify offers both Authentication and Personalization. For the most part, Authentication is
just Personalization + privacy. However, there are some key differences that are important to
be aware of, from most important to least:

### Security Guarantees

Authentication is a fully-fledged private documentation solution. Every aspect of your docs,
including page content, images, search results, and AI chat features, are completely inaccessible to
unauthenticated users.

Personalization, on the other hand, offers no security guarantees for your documentation content.
All page content, images, search results, and AI chat features can be accessed by the public. Even
if you are using the hidden pages feature of Personalization, a motivated attacker would still
be able to access the content of a hidden page.

### Handshake Methods

Due to the difference in security requirements for Authentication and Personalization, different
handshake methods are available for each. Both methods offer a JWT and OAuth Handshake, although
the setup steps are slightly different.

Authentication offers two additional Handshake methods:

- **Password Handshake**, which protects your website with a single configurable global password.

- **Mintlify Auth Handshake**, which will allow users to view your documentation only if they have
access to your dashboard.

Personalization offers one additional Handshake method:

- **Shared Session Handshake**, a super simple method which only requires setting up a single endpoint
that returns data for already-authenticated users.
