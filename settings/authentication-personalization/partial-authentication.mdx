Partial Authentication allows you to authenticate users to view only certain pages.

You can authenticate users through handshake methods such as:

- [Password](./authentication-setup/password)
- [JWT](./authentication-setup/jwt)
- [OAuth](./authentication-setup/oauth)
- [Mintlify dashboard](./authentication-setup/mintlify)

Partial Authentication shares all the same features as [Authentication](./authentication), but with the ability to allow unauthenticated users to view certain pages.

By default, all pages are protected. You can specify which pages should be publicly accessible by adding the `public` property to the page's frontmatter.

```mdx
---
title: "My Page"
public: true
---
```
