title: 'Password Handshake'
description: 'Use a set of shared passwords to authenticate users'

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the Password **Authentication** Handshake. The Password Handshake is not available for Personalization.
</Info>

If you don't have strict security requirements, or you don't want to manage a
database of documentation readers, you can use a set of shared passwords to
protect your docs.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a password">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/mintlify/mintlify/products/authentication) and create a password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share your password">
    Securely share the password with your documentation readers. That's it!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`. I don't want
to have to keep track of who can and cannot access the docs. My main use case for
authentication is to prevent competitors from snooping - password sharing is secure
enough for my team.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I go to my Mintlify dashboard and add at
least one password. I then share that password, along with the private docs URL,
with potential customers.
