# Deep Relative Snippets Test

This page is located at `/folder/nested/deep-relative-test.mdx` to test multi-level relative imports.

---

## Test 1: Two levels up (`../../snippets/`)

Importing from `/snippets/test-snippet-a.mdx` using `../../snippets/`:

import TestSnippetA from "../../snippets/test-snippet-a.mdx";

<TestSnippetA />

---

## Test 2: Two levels up with named export

Importing from `/snippets/test-snippet-b.mdx`:

import TestSnippetB, { testVariable } from "../../snippets/test-snippet-b.mdx";

<TestSnippetB />

**Exported variable value:** {testVariable}

---

## Test 3: One level up (`../`)

Importing from `/folder/local-snippet.mdx` (parent directory):

import LocalSnippet, { localMessage } from "../local-snippet.mdx";

<LocalSnippet />

**Exported variable value:** {localMessage}

---

## Test 4: Same directory sibling (`./`)

Importing from `/folder/nested/deep-snippet.mdx` (same directory):

import DeepSnippet, { deepMessage } from "./deep-snippet.mdx";

<DeepSnippet />

**Exported variable value:** {deepMessage}

---

## Test 5: Mixed - absolute path (for comparison)

Importing using absolute path:

import IconsRequired from "/snippets/icons-required.mdx";

<IconsRequired />

---
