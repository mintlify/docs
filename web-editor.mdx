> Navigation is currently controlled by the docs.json in your IDE. We are building out a file-tree system to enable users to control navigation in the Web Editor.

Web Editor lets you edit documentation without opening your IDE or running `mintlify dev`. It features a live preview, git workflow integration, and support for custom components.

## Quick Start

1. [Create or switch branches](#creating-new-branches) to avoid publishing directly to main
2. Make your edits using the [Visual Editor](#visual-editor) or [Source Editor](#source-editor)
3. [Commit your changes](#making-a-commit) or [create a pull request](#making-a-pull-request)

## Git Workflow Integration

<Note>
  Please install the Mintlify GitHub app to your account before using these features. Install from the [GitHub App page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) in your dashboard.
</Note>

### Creating new branches

To avoid publishing directly to your main docs site, switch to a different branch:

1. Open the branches modal on the top left of the editor
2. Either select an existing branch or create a new one by clicking "New Branch"

</Frame>

<Tip>
  Creating a new branch is recommended for changes that require review. You'll default back to the main branch when you reload the page.
</Tip>

### Making a commit

To save your changes:

- **On main branch**: Click the "Publish" button to push directly to the repository
- **On other branches**: Click the "Save Changes" button to commit to your branch

### Making a pull request

When ready for review:

1. Click the "Publish Pull Request" button
2. Edit the title and description or use the default provided
3. Submit to create the PR on GitHub

### Visual Editor

A WYSIWYG editor (like Notion) that shows a preview of your final docs while allowing direct editing. Access content blocks using slash commands (type `/`).

#### Available Content Blocks

**Standard markdown:**
- Paragraph, Headings
- Bullet and Numbered Lists
- Tables, Images, Blockquotes

**Mintlify components:**
- Callouts, Accordions, Accordion Groups
- Cards, Card Groups
- Code Blocks, Code Groups
- Tabs, Steps, Frames, Updates

### Source Editor

Edit your MDX files directly in code, similar to an IDE. This mode allows you to:
- Edit component props (not yet available in Visual Editor)
- Fix syntax errors incompatible with Visual Editor

### Diff View

Compare your changes before committing them to your repository.

## Working with Images

### Adding images

1. Type `/image` in Visual Editor
2. Choose to upload a new image or select an existing one
3. Complete the form with alt text and other properties

### Editing images

1. Hover over an image to reveal Edit and Delete buttons
2. Click Edit to modify attributes
3. To replace with a new image, delete the current one and add a new one

## Current Limitations

- **Navigation tree**: Not live-updated based on added/edited files
- **Snippet previews**: Custom snippets don't show previews yet
- **OpenAPI previews**: OpenAPI specs don't show previews yet
