You can use our [public packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping) to scrape documentation frameworks to Mintlify. 

We currently support migration for:
- Docusaurus
- GitBook
- ReadMe

Don't see your docs provider or have a home grown system? We can still help! Please get in touch at sales@mintlify.com.

## Commands

- `mintlify-scrape section [url]` - Scrapes multiple pages in a site.
- `mintlify-scrape page [url]` - Scrapes a single page in a site.


The commands will automatically detect the framework.
