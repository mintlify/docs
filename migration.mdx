  <Tab title="Automated migration">
    Migrate your documentation using the [@mintlify/scraping package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping). The package scrapes your content and converts it to use Mintlify components.

    ### Supported Platforms

    If your documentation is hosted on another platform, see the manual migration steps.

    ### Installing the scraper

    Install the `@mintlify/scraping` package to get started.

    ```bash
    npm install @mintlify/scraping@latest -g
    ```

    ### Scraping pages and sections

    The migration tool automatically detects your documentation platform and converts your content. Prepared files are stored locally in `./docs` by default.

    For large documentation sites, migrate smaller sections at a time rather than the entire site at once.

    **Migrate entire sections:**

    ```bash
    mintlify-scrape section https://your-docs-site.com/docs
    ```

    **Migrate single pages:**

    ```bash
    mintlify-scrape page https://your-docs-site.com/docs/getting-started
    ```

    **Migrate OpenAPI specifications:**

    ```bash
    mintlify-scrape openapi-file [openApiFilename]
    ```

    ### Add prepared content to your Mintlify project

    After scraping your existing documentation platform, you are ready to build your docs on Mintlify.

    Confirm that all of your pages have been migrated then add these files to the documentation repository that you created during the onboarding process. This is usually a GitHub repository.

  <Tab title="Manual migration">
    Migrate your documentation from any platform with full control over the process.

    ### Content migration

    To migrate your content to Mintlify, you will need:

    - A valid `docs.json` for your site settings and navigation. See [Global settings](/organize/settings) and [Navigation](/organize/navigation) for more information.
    - An `MDX` file for each page of your documentation. See [Pages](/organize/pages) for more information.
    - (Optional) An OpenAPI specification for your API endpoint pages. See [OpenAPI setup](/api-playground/openapi-setup) for more information.

    1. If your content is already in `MDX` format, copy the pages to your Mintlify project. Otherwise, convert your content to `MDX` format.
    2. Create your `docs.json` referencing the paths to your `MDX` pages.
    3. If you have OpenAPI specifications, add them to your `docs.json` and configure the API playground.

    ### Asset migration

    1. Copy assets to your repository's `images/` directory.
    2. Update references in your `MDX` files:

       ```mdx
       ![Alt text](/images/screenshot.png)
       ```
  </Tab>

## Post-migration checklist

After completing your migration (automated or manual), we recommend checking:

- All pages render
- Navigation works as intended
- Internal links resolve properly
- Images and assets load correctly
- Code blocks display with proper syntax highlighting
- Search functionality works
- Deployment is configured
- Custom domain is set up
