## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be comfortable creating, editing, and publishing documentation using the web editor. You'll understand how to work safely with branches and collaborate with your team through pull requests.

## Why use the web editor?

The web editor lets you focus on creating great content without worrying about technical setup. Whether you're a content creator, technical writer, or team member who prefers working in a browser, the web editor provides everything you need to maintain professional documentation.

Key benefits that make your work easier:
- **Visual editing**: See exactly how your content will look as you write it
- **No downloads required**: Everything works in your browser
- **Automatic backups**: Your changes sync with Git automatically
- **Team collaboration**: Work alongside colleagues in real-time
- **Professional results**: Create polished documentation without coding experience

## Getting started: Your first edit

Let's start with something simple to get you comfortable with the editor.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open any existing page">
    From your dashboard, click into the web editor and select any page from the file list on the left. Don't worry about making mistakes – we'll show you how to work safely with branches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try visual mode">
    The editor opens in visual mode by default, which shows you exactly how your content will appear to readers. Click anywhere in the text and make a small change, like updating a sentence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="See your changes instantly">
    Notice how your edits appear immediately, just like editing in a word processor. This instant feedback helps you create content that looks exactly the way you want.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to Markdown mode">
    Click the mode toggle in the top right corner to see the underlying code. Don't worry if it looks unfamiliar – you can always switch back to visual mode.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The beauty of the web editor is that you can work entirely in visual mode and still create professional documentation. Markdown mode is there if you want it, but it's never required.
</Tip>

## Understanding the two editing modes

The web editor gives you two ways to work, and you can switch between them anytime to match your comfort level and needs.

### Visual mode: Your main workspace

Think of visual mode like a word processor designed specifically for documentation. What you see is exactly what your readers will see, making it easy to create professional-looking content.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/visual-mode-light.png" 
    alt="Visual editing mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/visual-mode-dark.png" 
    alt="Visual editing mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

In visual mode, you can:
- Type and format text naturally
- Add components by pressing **/** to open the component menu
- See how images, code blocks, and callouts will look to readers
- Focus on your content without worrying about syntax

### Markdown mode: For precise control

Markdown mode shows you the underlying structure of your content. This is helpful when you need to fine-tune component settings or if you prefer working with code-like syntax.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/markdown-mode-light.png" 
    alt="Markdown mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/markdown-mode-dark.png" 
    alt="Markdown mode in the Mintlify Web Editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

You might use Markdown mode to:
- Copy and paste content that's already in Markdown format
- Adjust specific component properties
- Work with complex layouts that need precise control

<Note>
You can always switch between modes using the toggle in the top right corner. Your content stays the same – you're just choosing how to view and edit it.
</Note>

## Working safely with branches

Before making significant changes, let's learn about branches – your safety net for experimenting and collaborating without affecting your live documentation.

### Why branches matter for your workflow

Think of your main branch as your published documentation that readers see. A branch is like a private workspace where you can:
- Try out major changes without affecting your live site
- Work on content over multiple sessions
- Get feedback from colleagues before publishing
- Keep a clean history of what changes and when

This approach gives you confidence to experiment and iterate on your content.

### Creating your first branch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the branch name">
    In the editor toolbar, click the current branch name (usually **main**). This opens the branch menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select New Branch">
    Click **New Branch** to create your own workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your branch descriptively">
    Use names that describe what you're working on, like:
    - `update-getting-started-guide`
    - `add-troubleshooting-section`
    - `fix-installation-steps`
    
    Good names help you and your team understand what each branch contains.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create and start working">
    Click **Create Branch**. The editor automatically switches to your new branch, and you can start making changes safely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you're ever unsure whether a change might break something, create a branch first. It's much easier to experiment when you know your live documentation is protected.
</Tip>

## Creating and organizing content

Now that you understand how to work safely, let's explore how to create and structure your documentation.

### Adding content with the component menu

The web editor's component menu gives you access to all the elements that make documentation engaging and useful.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/component-menu-light.png" 
    alt="The unfurled component menu emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden" 
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/component-menu-dark.png" 
    alt="The unfurled component menu emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

To add components:
1. Place your cursor where you want to add something
2. Press **/** to open the component menu
3. Browse the options or type to search (try typing "step" or "code")
4. Click the component you want to add

Popular components and when to use them:
- **Callouts** (Info, Warning, Tip): Highlight important information
- **Steps**: Break down processes into clear, sequential actions
- **Code blocks**: Share code examples with syntax highlighting
- **Accordions**: Organize information that readers can expand when needed

### Creating new pages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the file creation menu">
    In the file explorer sidebar, click the **Create a new file** icon (+ symbol).
    
    <img
     src="/images/editor/files-menu-light.png"
     className="block dark:hidden rounded-2xl border border-gray-100 shadow-lg"
     style={{
       width: '268px',
       height: 'auto',
     }}
     alt="Files menu in the web editor."/>
   <img
     src="/images/editor/files-menu-dark.png"
     className="hidden dark:block rounded-2xl border border-white/10 shadow-lg"
     style={{
       width: '268px',
       height: 'auto',
     }}
     alt="Files menu in the web editor in dark mode."/>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a descriptive filename">
    Enter a filename that clearly describes the page content. Use lowercase letters and hyphens, like:
    - `getting-started.mdx`
    - `troubleshooting-guide.mdx`
    - `api-overview.mdx`
    
    The `.mdx` extension is added automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Press Enter and start writing">
    Your new page opens in the editor, ready for content. The editor provides a basic template to get you started.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Organizing your site structure

Your site's navigation is controlled by the `docs.json` file. Think of this as your site's table of contents – it determines how readers find and navigate through your content.

To update navigation:
1. Open `docs.json` from the file explorer
2. Find the `navigation` section
3. Add your new pages to the appropriate groups

Here's an example of adding a new "Themes" page to an existing "Profile" group:

```json title="Adding a page to navigation" highlight="18"
{
    "navigation": {
        "groups": [
            {
                "group": "Getting started",
                "pages": [
                    "index",
                    "quickstart",
                    "installation"
                ]
            },
            {
                "group": "Profile",
                "pages": [
                    "settings",
                    "account-types",
                    "dashboard",
                    "themes"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

<Info>
The page names in `docs.json` should match your filenames without the `.mdx` extension. So `themes.mdx` becomes `themes` in the configuration.
</Info>

## Publishing your work

You've created great content – now let's get it published. How your changes get published depends on whether you're working on your main branch or a feature branch.

### Understanding your publishing options

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/publish-flow-light.png" 
    alt="The publish button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden" 
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/publish-flow-dark.png" 
    alt="The publish button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

When you click **Publish**, what happens depends on your current branch:

**On your main branch**: Changes go live immediately on your documentation site. This is perfect for quick fixes and updates you're confident about.

**On a feature branch**: The editor creates a pull request, which lets you (and your team) review changes before they go live. This is ideal for larger updates or when you want feedback.

### Publishing directly (main branch)

If you're making small, confident changes directly on your main branch:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your changes">
    Look over what you've edited to make sure everything looks correct.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Publish">
    Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a description">
    Write a brief description of what you changed. This helps you track updates over time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm publishing">
    Click **Publish** to make your changes live. They'll appear on your documentation site within a few minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating a pull request (feature branches)

When you're working on a branch and want to review changes before publishing:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save your work">
    Make sure all your changes are saved by clicking **Save Changes** if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Publish Pull Request">
    Instead of just "Publish," you'll see **Publish Pull Request** when working on a branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write a clear title and description">
    Help reviewers (including future you) understand what changed:
    - **Good title**: "Update installation guide with new prerequisites"
    - **Good description**: "Added Node.js requirement and clarified OS compatibility based on user feedback"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the pull request">
    Click **Publish Pull Request**. The editor provides a link to view and manage your pull request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/pull-request-light.png" 
    alt="Publish pull request button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden" 
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/pull-request-dark.png" 
    alt="Publish pull request button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

## Collaborating with pull requests

Pull requests are your gateway to team collaboration and quality control. Even if you work alone, they're valuable for previewing major changes before they go live.

### Why pull requests improve your workflow

Pull requests provide:
- **Preview opportunity**: See exactly how changes will look before publishing
- **Team input**: Get feedback and suggestions from colleagues
- **Change history**: Keep a clear record of what changed and why
- **Quality control**: Catch issues before they affect your readers

### Reviewing and refining your pull request

After creating a pull request:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the changes online">
    Click the link to view your pull request in your Git provider (GitHub or GitLab). You'll see a comparison of what changed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make additional edits if needed">
    Return to the web editor to make any refinements. When you save changes, they automatically update your pull request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collaborate with your team">
    Team members can add comments, suggestions, or approve your changes. Use their feedback to improve your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge when ready">
    Once you and your team are satisfied, merge the pull request to publish your changes to the live site.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Even solo writers benefit from pull requests. They give you a final chance to review major changes in context before they go live, helping you catch issues you might miss when focused on writing.
</Tip>

## Essential Git concepts made simple

The web editor handles Git automatically, but understanding these concepts helps you work more confidently and collaborate effectively with developers on your team.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository: Your documentation's home">
    Think of your repository as the master filing cabinet for all your documentation files and their complete history. The web editor connects to this cabinet to access and modify your content safely.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit: A saved snapshot">
    Every time you save changes, you create a commit – a snapshot of your work at that moment. Commits include your changes plus a description of what you did, creating a helpful timeline of your documentation's evolution.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Branch: Your private workspace">
    A branch gives you a separate space to work on changes without affecting your live documentation. It's like having a draft copy where you can experiment freely before publishing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deployment branch: Your live content">
    This is the branch (usually called `main`) that contains your published documentation. When readers visit your docs site, they see the content from this branch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pull request: Your publishing proposal">
    A pull request lets you propose merging your branch changes into your live documentation. It's your opportunity to review, discuss, and refine changes before they go public.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Diff: What changed">
    A diff shows the specific differences between two versions of your content, highlighting what was added, removed, or modified. This helps you understand exactly what each change does.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What the web editor handles for you

You don't need to learn Git commands – the web editor manages everything behind the scenes:

- **Opening files**: Automatically fetches the latest version from your repository
- **Tracking changes**: Keeps track of your edits as you work
- **Saving work**: Creates commits with your changes and helpful descriptions
- **Managing branches**: Creates and switches between branches as needed
- **Publishing**: Pushes changes to your live site or creates pull requests for review

This automation lets you focus on creating great content while maintaining professional version control practices.

## Troubleshooting common issues

Even with the web editor's user-friendly design, you might occasionally encounter issues. Here are solutions to the most common problems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My changes aren't showing up after publishing">
    This usually happens because deployments take a few minutes or your browser is showing cached content.

    **Try these solutions:**
    1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete, then check your site again
    2. Hard refresh your browser: **Ctrl + F5** (Windows) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
    3. Clear your browser cache if the issue persists
    4. Check your dashboard for deployment status – there might be an error to resolve
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I can't save or publish my changes">
    This typically indicates a permissions issue with your Git repository or authentication problems.

    **Check these items:**
    1. Verify you have write access to the documentation repository
    2. Ensure your Git integration (GitHub or GitLab) is properly connected
    3. Try refreshing the page and attempting the save again
    4. Contact your admin if you're unsure about your permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The editor is loading slowly or not at all">
    Network issues or large repositories can sometimes cause loading problems.

    **Try these steps:**
    1. Check your internet connection stability
    2. Refresh the page and wait a bit longer for loading
    3. Try using a different browser or clearing your browser cache
    4. If you have a very large documentation repository, loading may take longer than usual
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I accidentally deleted something important">
    Don't panic! Git keeps a complete history of all your changes, so nothing is permanently lost.

    **Recovery options:**
    1. If you haven't saved yet, use **Ctrl + Z** (Windows) or **Cmd + Z** (Mac) to undo
    2. If you've already saved, ask a team member with Git experience to help restore from the repository history
    3. Check if you have the content backed up elsewhere and can re-add it
    4. Contact support if you need help recovering important content
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
