## Introduction

The web editor is a visual interface for creating, editing, and reviewing documentation directly in your browser.

- **Visual editing**: Make changes to your documentation using a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor that shows how your content will look when published.
- **Git synchronization**: All changes automatically sync with your Git repository to maintain version control.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on documentation simultaneously, with changes visible to everyone.
- **No setup required**: Start writing immediately from your dashboard.

### Web editor flow

Here is how you'll typically work in the web editor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your branch">
    Create a branch or make changes directly to your deployment branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your file">
    Navigate to an existing file or create a new one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your content">
    Make changes in the web editor using either visual mode or Markdown mode. Your changes save automatically as you type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview your changes">
    See how your changes will appear in visual mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your changes">
    If you're working on your deployment branch, publish your changes directly from the web editor. On other branches, publish your changes through a pull request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor modes

The web editor has two modes to accommodate different editing preferences and needs.

You can switch between modes at any time using the toggle in the top right corner of the editor toolbar.

    src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png" 
    alt="Mode toggle icons highlighted in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Visual mode

Visual mode provides a WYSIWYG experience where the changes that you make in the editor are the changes that will be published to your documentation site. This mode is ideal for when you want to see how your changes will look in real-time.

  <img 
    src="/images/editor/visual-mode-dark.png" 
    alt="Visual editing mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Markdown mode

Markdown mode provides direct access to the underlying `MDX` code of your documentation. `MDX` combines Markdown syntax with React components, giving you full control over your content structure. This mode is ideal for when you need precise control over component properties or when you prefer to write in Markdown syntax.

## Git fundamentals

The web editor performs Git operations behind the scenes. Understanding these concepts will help you work more effectively with the web editor.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository">
    Your documentation's source where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your repository to access and modify content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit">
    A saved snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Branch">
    A separate workspace for making changes without affecting your live documentation. Think of it as a safe sandbox for experiments and larger updates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pull Request">
    A way to propose merging your branch changes into your live documentation. Allows for review and discussion before changes go live.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Diff">
    A diff (or difference) shows the specific changes between two versions of a file. When reviewing pull requests, diffs highlight what has been added, removed, or modified.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What the web editor does for you

The web editor connects to your Git repository through our [GitHub App](/settings/github) or [GitLab integration](/settings/gitlab) and handles Git automatically. When you:

- **Open a file**: Fetches the latest version from your repository.
- **Make changes in a file**: Tracks your changes as a draft that can become a Git commit.
- **Save changes**: Creates a commit with your changes.
- **Create a branch**: Creates a new branch in your repository.
- **Publish on your deployment branch**: Creates a commit and pushes directly to your deployment branch.
- **Publish on other branches**: Creates a commit and opens a pull request.

### When to use branches

Branches let you work on changes without affecting the content on your live site. When your changes are ready, you can merge them into your deployment branch with a pull request.

**Best practice: Always work from branches.** This ensures your live documentation stays stable and enables proper review workflows.

## Creating a Branch

1. Select the branch name in the editor toolbar (usually `main` by default).
2. Select **New Branch**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your branch.
4. Select **Create Branch**.

### Switching Branches

1. Select the current branch name in the editor toolbar.
2. Select the branch that you want to switch to from the dropdown menu.

## Making changes

### Saving Changes on a Branch

To save your changes on a branch, select the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner of the editor. 

When you are working on a branch, your changes are not automatically saved.

### Finding and creating files

Use the sidebar file explorer to navigate through your documentation, or select <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Windows) to search for files.

### Editing content

Make changes using either visual mode or Markdown mode. Your changes save automatically as you type.

#### Component Menu

You can add content blocks and other components to your documentation in visual mode using the dropdown component menu.

1. Press the `/` key to open the component menu.
2. Select a component from the menu.

  <img 
    src="/images/editor/component-menu-dark.png" 
    alt="The unfurled component menu emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

## Pull Requests and reviewing changes

Pull requests (or PRs) let you and other people review changes that you've made on a branch and then merge those changes into your documentation.

See how your changes will appear in visual mode.

### Creating a Pull Request on a Branch 

1. Make your changes on a branch.
2. Click the **Publish Pull Request** button in the top-right corner of the editor.
3. Add a Pull Request Title and Description for your pull request. A good title and description will help reviewers understand the changes you've made.
4. Click **Publish Pull Request**.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/pull-request-light.png" 
    alt="Publish pull request button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden" 
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/pull-request-dark.png" 
    alt="Publish pull request button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

### Reviewing Pull Requests

You can review pull requests in your Git platform (GitHub, GitLab).

After you create a pull request, you can see a preview deployment of the changes.

After a reviewer approves a pull request, you can merge it to deploy the changes to your live documentation site.


## Publishing changes

Select the **Publish** button to publish your changes to your live documentation site.

The **Publish** button works differently depending on your branch:

* **Deployment branch**: Updates your live site immediately. This is usually the `main` branch.
* **Other branches**: Creates a pull request for review.
