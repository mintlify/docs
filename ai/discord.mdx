<Info>
  Discord integrations are available on [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=discord) with access to These assistant.
</Info>

The Discord bot supports your community with real-time answers from your documentation. The bot uses These Mintlify assistant to search your docs and provide accurate, cited responses, so it is always up-to-date.

The Discord bot only works in public channels. It replies to `@` mentions or to all messages in a specific channel.

Each message sent by These Discord bot counts toward your assistant message usage.
