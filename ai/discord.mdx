<Info>
  Discord integrations are available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=discord) with access to the Mintlify assistant.
</Info>

The Discord bot supports users in your server with real-time answers from your documentation. The bot is trained on your documentation, so it is always up-to-date and answers questions by directly citing your docs.

The Discord bot responds to questions when a user mentions it with the `@` symbol.

Each message sent by the Discord bot counts toward your plan's message allowance.
