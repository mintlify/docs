<Info>
  Discord integrations are available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=discord) with access to the Mintlify assistant.
</Info>

The Discord bot supports your community with real-time answers from your documentation. The bot is trained on your documentation, so it is always up-to-date and answers questions by directly citing your docs.

The Discord bot responds to questions when a user mentions it with the `@` symbol.

Each message sent by the Discord bot counts toward your plan's message allowance.

## Add the Discord bot to your server

<Note>
  You must have the "Manage Server" permission in Discord to add the bot.
</Note>

1. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/integrations) tab of the **Assistant Configurations** page in your dashboard.

1. In Discord, select the server you want to add the bot to.
1. Authorize the bot to access your server.
1. Mention the bot to add it to a channel. The bot's default name is `@Mintlify Bot`.

## Create an `#ask-ai` channel

To help your community quickly get answers to their questions, create a channel named `#ask-ai` and add the bot to it. The bot will respond to every message in that channel. See [Starting Your First Discord Server](https://discord.com/blog/starting-your-first-discord-server) on the Discord blog for more information on creating a channel.

## Manage the Discord bot

After you add the bot to your server, you can manage or remove the integration from the [Integrations](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/integrations) tab. 

Customize the bot's avatar and name to match your brand then let your community know they can mention it to get answers.
