<Info>
  Discord integrations are available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=discord) with access to the Mintlify assistant.
</Info>

Bring the knowledge in your documentation to your Discord server with the Mintlify assistant. The assistant powers a bot that answers user questions with information from your documentation. The bot searches your documentation to provide accurate, cited responses.

The Discord bot responds to questions when a user mentions it with the `@` symbol.

Each message sent by the Discord bot counts toward your plan's message allowance.
