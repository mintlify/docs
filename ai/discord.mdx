<Info>
  Discord integrations are available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=discord) with access to the assistant.
</Info>

The Discord bot answers questions from your documentation using the Mintlify assistant. It responds to `@` mentions and to every message in channels named `#ask-ai`.

The bot only works in public channels. Each message counts toward your assistant message usage.

## Add the Discord bot

<Note>
  You must have the "Manage Server" permission in Discord.
</Note>

1. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/integrations) tab in your dashboard.
1. In the Discord card, click **Connect**.
