<Note>
  Agent suggestions are available on [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=autopilot). To enable suggestions for your organization, [contact our sales team](mailto:gtm@mintlify.com). 
</Note>

You can allow the [agent](/ai/agent) to monitor your selected Git repositories and suggest documentation updates. When the agent identifies potential user-facing changes in your application, it prepares context for you to create a pull request to update your documentation with one click.

Use suggestions to proactively keep your documentation up to date when new features or updates ship.

## Prerequisites

Before using suggestions, you must install the [Mintlify GitHub App](/deploy/github) in your organization. The app must have access to your documentation repository and at least one other repository where code changes require documentation updates.

## Configure suggestions

Configure which repositories the agent makes suggestions for in the agent settings.

The configuration page displays all GitHub organizations where you've installed the Mintlify GitHub App and which repositories the agent is monitoring.

### Select repositories to monitor

After installing the Mintlify GitHub App on your organizations, select which repositories to monitor.

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard. 
1. Click the **Settings** button.

    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-dark.png" alt="The settings button in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the gear icon next to the organization name.
    <Frame>

      <img src="/images/suggestions/org-config-dark.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the toggle on next to each repository you want to monitor.
1. Use the search bar to filter repositories by name.
1. Click **Enable all** or **Disable all** to configure all repositories at once.

The agent monitors the default branch (typically `main`) for each repository. When a pull request merges to this branch, the agent analyzes the changes and creates suggestions.

### Stop monitoring a repository

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard. 
1. Click the **Settings** button.
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-light.png" alt="The settings button in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-dark.png" alt="The settings button in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the gear icon next to the organization name.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/suggestions/org-config-light.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/suggestions/org-config-dark.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the toggle off next to the repository you want to stop monitoring.
1. Use the search bar to filter repositories by name.

The agent immediately stops monitoring the repository. Any existing suggestions for that repository remain in your dashboard until you dismiss them.

## Review suggestions

When the agent detects user-facing changes in your monitored repositories, it creates suggestions that appear in your dashboard. Each suggestion displays the pull request title, repository name, when the suggestion was created, and proposed documentation updates.

The **Ask agent** button in your dashboard displays the number of suggestions waiting for your review.

### Create pull requests

Add suggestions as context for the agent to create pull requests.

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard.
1. Click **Add to chat**.
1. Use the agent chat panel to refine the suggested documentation updates or create a pull request.

### Dismiss suggestions

If a suggestion doesn't require documentation updates or you've already addressed the changes, dismiss it to remove it from your dashboard.

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard.
1. Click **Dismiss**.

The suggestion is immediately removed from your dashboard. You cannot retrieve dismissed suggestions.
