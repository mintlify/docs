<Note>
  Agent suggestions are available on [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=autopilot). To enable suggestions for your organization, [contact our sales team](mailto:gtm@mintlify.com). 
</Note>

You can allow the agent to monitor your selected Git repositories and suggest documentation updates. When the agent identifies potential user-facing changes in your application, it prepares context for you to create a pull request to update your documentation with one click.

Use suggestions to proactively keep your documentation up to date when new features or updates ship.

## Prerequisites

Before using suggestions, you must install the [Mintlify GitHub App](/deploy/github) in your organization. The app must have access to your documentation repository and at least one other repository where code changes require documentation updates.

## Access suggestions

TODO: Navigate to the [autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard to view suggestions and configure repository monitoring. The autopilot page shows pending suggestions that need your review and provides access to configuration settings.

## Configure suggestions
TODO:
Configure autopilot settings from the autopilot page by clicking the **Configuration** button.

</Frame>

The configuration page displays all GitHub organizations where you've installed the Mintlify GitHub App and which repositories autopilot is monitoring.

### Select repositories to monitor

After installing the Mintlify GitHub App on your organizations, select which repositories to monitor.
TODO:
1. Navigate to the [autopilot settings page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot/settings).
1. Find the GitHub organization that the repository you want to monitor belongs to.
1. Click the gear icon next to the organization name.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/autopilot/org-config-light.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/autopilot/org-config-dark.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the toggle on next to each repository you want to monitor.
1. Use the search bar to filter repositories by name.
1. Click **Enable all** or **Disable all** to quickly configure all repositories.

Autopilot monitors the default branch (typically `main`) for each repository. When a pull request merges to this branch, autopilot analyzes the changes and creates suggestions.

### Stop monitoring a repository
TODO:
1. Navigate to the [autopilot settings page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot/settings).
1. Find the GitHub organization that the repository you want to stop monitoring belongs to.
1. Click the gear icon next to the organization name.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/autopilot/org-config-light.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/autopilot/org-config-dark.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the toggle off next to the repository you want to stop monitoring.
1. Use the search bar to filter repositories by name.

The agent immediately stops monitoring the repository. Any existing suggestions for that repository remain in your dashboard until you dismiss them.

## Review suggestions
TODO:
When the agent detects user-facing changes in your monitored repositories, it creates suggestions that appear in your dashboard. Each suggestion displays the pull request title, repository name, summary for why the change may need documentation updates, and when the suggestion was created.

### Apply suggestions
TODO:
When you apply a suggestion, autopilot opens the [agent](/ai/agent) panel with context about the pull request. The agent receives the pull request URL and a summary about the changed files.

1. Navigate to the [autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard.
1. Click **Apply suggestion**.
1. Use the agent interface to refine the suggested documentation updates or create a pull request.

### Dismiss suggestions

If a suggestion doesn't require documentation updates or you've already addressed the changes, dismiss it to remove it from your dashboard.

1. Navigate to the [autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard.
1. Click **Dismiss**.

The suggestion is immediately removed from your visible list. You cannot retrieve dismissed suggestions.
