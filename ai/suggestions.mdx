<Note>
  Agent suggestions are available on [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=autopilot). To enable suggestions for your organization, [contact our sales team](mailto:gtm@mintlify.com). 
</Note>

You can allow the [agent](/ai/agent) to suggest documentation updates from two sources.

- **Pull request changes**: Monitor selected Git repositories for code changes that require documentation updates.
- **Assistant conversations**: Analyze questions that users ask the assistant on your documentation site to identify content gaps.

When the agent identifies potential documentation updates, it creates a suggestion in your dashboard with context to create a pull request.

Use suggestions to proactively keep your documentation up to date when new features ship or to address common user questions.

## Prerequisites

Before using suggestions, you must install the [Mintlify GitHub App](/deploy/github) in your organization. The app must have access to your documentation repository and at least one other repository where code changes require documentation updates.

## Configure suggestions

Configure which repositories the agent monitors and how you receive notifications in the agent settings. The settings page displays all the GitHub organizations and repositories the agent is monitoring.

To access the agent settings:

1. Click the **Ask agent** button in your dashboard to open the agent panel.
1. Click the **Settings** button.

    </Frame>

### Monitor repositories

The agent monitors all merged pull requests for each repository that you enable, regardless of which branch they're merged into. A GitHub check named **Mintlify Autopilot** runs on pull requests in monitored repositories to analyze them for potential documentation updates. When you merge a pull request that requires documentation updates, the agent creates a suggestion in your dashboard.

<Note>
  When you first enable monitoring for a repository, the agent creates suggestions for pull requests merged in the last seven days. This backfill only occurs if no suggestions already exist for that repository. You may see multiple suggestions appear immediately after enabling monitoring.
</Note>

If you disable monitoring, the agent immediately stops monitoring the repository. Any existing suggestions for that repository remain in your dashboard until you dismiss them.

### Conversation insights

Enable conversation insights to receive suggestions based on common questions users ask the assistant.

When enabled, the agent periodically analyzes assistant conversations and creates suggestions when it identifies patterns of questions that indicate missing or unclear documentation.

### Notifications

Agent suggestions always appear in your dashboard. You can configure notifications to receive email or Slack direct messages when the agent creates new suggestions.

<Tip>
  If you don't receive email notifications for suggestions, check your spam folder and add the email address `notifications@mintlify.com` to your safe sender list.
</Tip>

## Review suggestions

The agent creates suggestions in your dashboard. Each suggestion shows the pull request or assistant conversation topic that triggered the suggestion, creation date, and proposed documentation updates.

The **Ask agent** button in your dashboard displays the number of suggestions waiting for your review.

### Create pull requests

Add suggestions as context for the agent to create pull requests.

1. Click the **Ask agent** button in your dashboard to open the agent panel.
1. Click **Add to chat**.
1. Submit the prompt to the agent to open a pull request.

### Dismiss suggestions

If a suggestion doesn't require documentation updates or you've already addressed the changes, dismiss it to remove it from your dashboard.

1. Click the **Ask agent** button in your dashboard to open the agent panel.
1. Click the **Dismiss** button next to any suggestions that you want to dismiss.

The suggestion is immediately removed from your dashboard. You cannot retrieve dismissed suggestions.
