<Note>
  Agent suggestions are available on [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=autopilot). To enable suggestions for your organization, [contact our sales team](mailto:gtm@mintlify.com). 
</Note>

You can allow the [agent](/ai/agent) to monitor your selected Git repositories and suggest documentation updates. When the agent identifies potential user-facing changes in your application, it prepares context for you to create a pull request to update your documentation with one click.

Use suggestions to proactively keep your documentation up to date when new features or updates ship.

## Prerequisites

Before using suggestions, you must install the [Mintlify GitHub App](/deploy/github) in your organization. The app must have access to your documentation repository and at least one other repository where code changes require documentation updates.

## Configure suggestions

Configure which repositories the agent makes suggestions for in the agent settings.

The configuration page displays all GitHub organizations where you've installed the Mintlify GitHub App and which repositories the agent is monitoring.

### Select repositories to monitor

After installing the Mintlify GitHub App on your organizations, select which repositories to monitor.

1. Click the **Ask agent** button in your dashboard to open the agent panel.
1. Click the **Settings** button.

    </Frame>
1. In the **Monitor Repositories** section, click the organization name that contains the repositories you want to monitor.
1. Click the toggle on next to each repository you want to monitor, or click **Enable all** to monitor all repositories in the organization.

The agent monitors the default branch (typically `main`) for each repository. A GitHub check named **Mintlify Autopilot** runs on pull requests in monitored repositories to analyze them for potential documentation updates. When you merge a pull request that requires documentation updates, the agent creates a suggestion in your dashboard.

<Note>
  When you first enable monitoring for a repository, the agent creates suggestions for pull requests merged in the last seven days. This backfill only occurs if no suggestions already exist for that repository. You may see multiple suggestions appear immediately after enabling monitoring.
</Note>

### Stop monitoring a repository

1. Click the **Ask agent** button in your dashboard to open the agent panel.
1. Click the **Settings** button.
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-light.png" alt="The settings button in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-dark.png" alt="The settings button in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. In the **Monitor Repositories** section, click the organization name that contains the repositories you want to stop monitoring.
1. Click the toggle off next to the repository you want to stop monitoring, or click **Disable all** to stop monitoring all repositories in the organization.

The agent immediately stops monitoring the repository. Any existing suggestions for that repository remain in your dashboard until you dismiss them.

## Review suggestions

When the agent detects user-facing changes in your monitored repositories, it creates a suggestion in your dashboard. Each suggestion shows the pull request title, repository name, creation date, and proposed documentation updates.

The **Ask agent** button in your dashboard displays the number of suggestions waiting for your review.

### Create pull requests

Add suggestions as context for the agent to create pull requests.

1. Click the **Ask agent** button in your dashboard to open the agent panel.
1. Click **Add to chat**.
1. Submit the prompt to the agent to open a pull request.

### Dismiss suggestions

If a suggestion doesn't require documentation updates or you've already addressed the changes, dismiss it to remove it from your dashboard.

1. Click the **Ask agent** button in your dashboard to open the agent panel.
1. Click the **Dismiss** button next any suggestions that you want to dismiss.

The suggestion is immediately removed from your dashboard. You cannot retrieve dismissed suggestions.
