## About assistant integrations

Assistant integrations extend your Mintlify Assistant to Discord servers and Slack workspaces. When connected, the assistant can answer questions about your documentation directly in your community channels, helping users find information without leaving their preferred communication platform.

The assistant uses the same AI-powered search and retrieval system as the web assistant, providing:

* **Accurate answers** from your documentation with source citations.
* **Code examples** that users can copy and implement.
* **Contextual responses** based on your documentation content.

Each message sent through Discord or Slack integrations counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages from the web assistant.

## Access integrations

Navigate to the integrations page from your dashboard to connect Discord and Slack.

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select your documentation site.
3. Navigate to **Products** > **Assistant** > **Settings**.
4. Click the **Integrations** tab.

### View connection status

The integrations page shows the connection status for each integration:

- **Connected apps**: Integrations currently connected to your documentation.
- **All Apps**: Available integrations that you can connect.

Each connected integration displays a **Connected** status badge and a **Configure** button.

### Disconnect an integration

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab in your Assistant settings.
2. Find the integration in the **Connected apps** section.
3. Click **Configure**.
4. Click **Disconnect** or **Remove**.
5. Confirm the disconnection.

After disconnecting, the integration moves back to the **All Apps** section and the assistant stops responding in that platform.

## How integrations work

When you connect Discord or Slack, the assistant monitors messages in enabled channels. Users can ask questions naturally, and the assistant responds with information from your documentation.

### Message handling

The assistant processes messages in connected channels:

1. A user asks a question in an enabled channel.
2. The assistant searches your documentation for relevant information.
3. The assistant responds with an answer, citing sources from your documentation.
4. Users can click source links to view the full documentation page.

### Privacy and permissions

Integrations require specific permissions to function:

**Discord permissions:**
- Read messages in enabled channels.
- Send messages in enabled channels.
- Embed links to documentation.

**Slack permissions:**
- Read messages in enabled channels.
- Send messages in enabled channels.
- Embed links to documentation.

The assistant only accesses channels you explicitly enable. It does not read or store messages from other channels.
