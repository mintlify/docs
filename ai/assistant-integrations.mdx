## About assistant integrations

Connect your Discord servers and Slack workspaces to the Mintlify Assistant to provide AI-powered answers to questions in your community channels. The assistant uses the same agentic RAG technology as the documentation assistant to search your docs and provide accurate, cited responses.

When users ask questions in connected channels, the assistant:

* **Searches your documentation** to find relevant information.
* **Provides accurate answers** with citations and links to source pages.
* **Generates code examples** to help users implement solutions.

Each message sent through Discord or Slack integrations counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages from your documentation site.

## Access integrations

Navigate to the integrations page in your dashboard to connect Discord and Slack:

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select your deployment.
3. Navigate to **Products** → **Assistant** → **Settings** → **Integrations**.
