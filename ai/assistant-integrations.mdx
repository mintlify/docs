## About assistant integrations

Assistant integrations extend your Mintlify Assistant beyond your documentation site to answer questions in your Discord servers and Slack workspaces. The assistant uses the same AI-powered search and response capabilities to help users find answers directly in the channels where they collaborate.

When connected, the assistant:

* **Answers questions** in Discord and Slack channels using your documentation as the knowledge base.
* **Cites sources** with links back to your documentation pages.
* **Generates code examples** to help users implement solutions.

Each message sent to the assistant in Discord or Slack counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages from your documentation site.

## Access integrations

Manage your assistant integrations from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select your documentation site.
3. Click **Products** > **Assistant** > **Settings**.
4. Click the **Integrations** tab.

The integrations page displays all available integrations and their connection status. Connected integrations appear in the **Connected apps** section, while available integrations appear in the **All Apps** section.
