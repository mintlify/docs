## About assistant integrations

Assistant integrations extend your Mintlify Assistant beyond your documentation site into the platforms where your community already communicates. Connect Discord servers and Slack workspaces to enable AI-powered documentation assistance directly in your channels.

When connected, the assistant:

* **Answers questions** about your documentation in Discord and Slack channels.
* **Cites sources** with links back to your documentation.
* **Provides accurate responses** using the same AI model that powers your documentation assistant.

Each message sent through integrated platforms counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages from your documentation site.

## Access integrations

Navigate to the integrations page from your dashboard:

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select your documentation site.
3. Click **Products** > **Assistant** > **Settings**.
4. Click the **Integrations** tab.
