Connect your Discord servers and Slack workspaces to the Mintlify Assistant to provide AI-powered documentation support directly in your community channels. The assistant answers questions using your documentation, helping users get instant help where they already communicate.

## About assistant integrations

Assistant integrations extend your documentation's AI capabilities to Discord and Slack. When connected, the assistant:

* **Answers questions** in Discord and Slack channels using your documentation as context.
* **Cites sources** with links back to your documentation pages.
* **Provides instant support** to your community without requiring them to visit your docs site.

Each message sent through Discord or Slack integrations counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages from your documentation site.

## Access integrations

Navigate to the Integrations tab in your Assistant settings to manage your connected apps.

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select your documentation project.
3. Navigate to **Products** > **Assistant** > **Settings**.
4. Click the **Integrations** tab.
