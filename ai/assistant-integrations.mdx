## About assistant integrations

Connect your Discord servers and Slack workspaces to the Mintlify Assistant to provide AI-powered documentation support directly in your community channels. The assistant answers questions about your documentation using the same agentic RAG technology that powers the embedded assistant on your docs site.

When users ask questions in connected channels, the assistant:

* **Searches your documentation** to find relevant information and provide accurate answers.
* **Cites sources** with links back to your documentation pages.
* **Generates code examples** to help users implement solutions.

Each message sent to the assistant in Discord or Slack counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages from your embedded assistant.

## Access integrations

Manage your assistant integrations from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Assistant** from the products menu.
3. Click the **Integrations** tab.

## Usage and billing

Messages sent to the assistant in Discord and Slack count toward your plan's message allowance. Monitor your usage from the [Assistant dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant).
