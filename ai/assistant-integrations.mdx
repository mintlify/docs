Connect your Discord servers and Slack workspaces to the Mintlify Assistant to provide AI-powered documentation support directly in your community channels. The assistant answers questions using information from your documentation, helping users get instant help without leaving their preferred communication platform.

## About assistant integrations

Assistant integrations extend your documentation's AI capabilities to Discord and Slack. When connected, the assistant:

* **Answers questions** in Discord servers and Slack channels using information from your documentation.
* **Cites sources** with links back to your documentation pages.
* **Provides context-aware responses** based on your documentation content.

Each message sent through Discord or Slack integrations counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages sent through your documentation site.

Navigate to the integrations page in your dashboard to connect Discord and Slack:

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Assistant** from the products menu.
