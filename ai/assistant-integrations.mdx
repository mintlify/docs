## About assistant integrations

Connect your Discord servers and Slack workspaces to the Mintlify Assistant to provide AI-powered support directly in your community channels. The assistant answers questions using your documentation, helping users get instant answers without leaving their preferred communication platform.

When connected, the assistant:

* **Answers questions** in Discord and Slack channels using information from your documentation.
* **Cites sources** with links back to your documentation pages.
* **Provides context-aware responses** based on your documentation content.

Each message sent to the assistant in Discord or Slack counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages from your documentation site.

## Access integrations

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Assistant** from the products menu.
3. Click the **Integrations** tab.
