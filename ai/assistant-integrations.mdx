Connect your Discord servers and Slack workspaces to the Mintlify Assistant to provide AI-powered documentation support directly in your community channels. The assistant answers questions using your documentation, helping users get instant answers without leaving their preferred communication platform.

## About assistant integrations

Assistant integrations extend the Mintlify Assistant to Discord and Slack channels. When connected, the assistant:

* **Answers questions** about your documentation in Discord and Slack channels.
* **Cites sources** with links back to your documentation.
* **Generates code examples** to help users implement solutions.

Each message sent through Discord or Slack integrations counts toward your plan's message allowance, just like messages sent through your documentation site.

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
