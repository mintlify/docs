The `install.md` file is designed for autonomous AI agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, and Aider) to execute installation tasks without human intervention. It aggregates installation-related documentation into a single, actionable markdown file optimized for AI agent execution.

Mintlify automatically generates an `install.md` file at the root of your project by identifying and synthesizing installation-related pages. This file is always up to date and requires zero maintenance.

View your `install.md` by appending `/install.md` to your documentation site's URL.

## How it works

Mintlify automatically:

1. **Identifies installation pages** - Scans your documentation for pages with installation-related keywords in their paths or titles (installation, quickstart, getting-started, setup, intro)
2. **Prioritizes content** - Sorts pages by relevance, prioritizing exact "install" matches, then installation guides, quickstarts, and getting-started pages
3. **Synthesizes instructions** - Uses Claude Opus 4.5 to transform human-oriented documentation into direct, actionable task descriptions for AI agents
4. **Generates task lists** - Creates a TODO checklist with markdown checkboxes for agents to execute autonomously

## What pages are included

The `install.md` file includes pages that match these keywords in their path or title:

- `installation` or `install`
- `quickstart` or `quick-start`
- `getting-started` or `getting_started`
- `setup` or `set-up`
- `introduction` or `intro`
- `overview`

Pages are automatically filtered to include only:
- Public pages (not hidden or behind authentication)
- Pages from the default version and language (if versioning/languages are configured)
- Pages that should be indexed according to your navigation settings

## install.md structure

An `install.md` file is structured for autonomous execution:

1. **User instruction framing** - Opens with a conversational request: "I want you to install [product] for me. Execute all the steps below autonomously."
2. **Objective** - Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished
3. **Success condition** - Specific measurable outcome (e.g., "server running at localhost:3000")
4. **TODO checklist** - Markdown checkboxes with 3-7 high-level tasks
5. **Detailed instructions** - Step-by-step commands with all necessary shell commands, URLs, and platform-specific instructions
6. **Execution directive** - Closing statement that triggers immediate action

```mdx Example install.md
# Project Name

> Project description

I want you to install Project Name for me. Execute all the steps below autonomously.

OBJECTIVE: Install and set up Project Name

DONE WHEN: Project Name is successfully installed and operational

## TODO

- [ ] Install the CLI globally using npm
- [ ] Verify installation with version check
- [ ] Create a new project
- [ ] Start the development server

[Detailed installation commands and instructions...]

EXECUTE NOW: Complete the above TODO list to achieve: Project Name successfully installed and operational

> If you think the above is not enough to accomplish the task, you can find navigation and other pages relevant to this product by using the llms.txt file at: https://example.com/llms.txt
```

## Custom install.md

To add a custom `install.md` file, create an `install.md` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file will override the automatically generated file. If you delete the custom file, the default file will be used again.

Your custom `install.md` file should follow the structure outlined above for optimal AI agent execution.
