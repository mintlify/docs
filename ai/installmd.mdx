The `install.md` file provides task-oriented installation instructions designed for autonomous AI agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and Aider. Unlike traditional documentation written for human readers, `install.md` presents installation steps as direct commands that AI agents can execute autonomously.

Mintlify automatically generates an `install.md` file at the root of your project by aggregating and synthesizing installation-related documentation pages. This file is always up to date and requires zero maintenance.

View your `install.md` by appending `/install.md` to your documentation site's URL.

## How it works

Mintlify automatically identifies pages in your documentation that contain installation-related content by matching keywords in page paths and titles, including:

- `installation` or `install`
- `quickstart` or `quick-start`
- `getting-started` or `getting_started`
- `setup` or `set-up`
- `introduction` or `intro`
- `overview`

The system then uses Claude Opus 4.5 to synthesize these pages into a concise, task-oriented format optimized for AI agent execution. The synthesis process:

1. Extracts all shell commands, URLs, and platform-specific instructions
2. Reorganizes content into a clear objective with success criteria
3. Presents steps as direct commands rather than passive documentation
4. Includes a TODO checklist for agents to track progress
5. Removes troubleshooting sections and optional features to focus on the core installation path

## install.md structure

An `install.md` file is a plain Markdown file that contains:

- **Conversational opening** - Frames the content as a user request to trigger autonomous execution
- **Objective statement** - Clear goal of what needs to be installed
- **Success condition** - Specific measurable outcome that proves successful installation
- **TODO checklist** - High-level tasks with markdown checkboxes
- **Detailed instructions** - Step-by-step commands with all necessary shell commands
- **Execution directive** - Closing statement that triggers immediate action

```mdx Example install.md
I want you to install Mintlify for me. Execute all the steps below autonomously.

OBJECTIVE: Install the Mintlify CLI and preview documentation locally

DONE WHEN: Local preview server running at localhost:3000

## TODO

- [ ] Install the Mintlify CLI globally
- [ ] Clone the documentation repository
- [ ] Start the local preview server
- [ ] Verify the preview is accessible

## Install the CLI

You need to install the Mintlify CLI globally using npm:

\`\`\`bash
npm i -g mint
\`\`\`

## Clone Your Repository

Your task is to clone your documentation repository:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
cd your-repo
\`\`\`

## Start Preview Server

You must start the local development server:

\`\`\`bash
mint dev
\`\`\`

EXECUTE NOW: Complete the above TODO list to achieve: Local preview server running at localhost:3000
```

## What pages are included

The `install.md` file includes content from pages that match installation-related keywords. Pages are prioritized by relevance:

1. Exact matches for "install" or "installation"
2. Pages containing "quickstart" or "quick-start"
3. Pages containing "getting-started" or "getting_started"
4. Pages containing "setup" or "set-up"
5. Pages containing "introduction" or "intro"
6. Pages containing "overview"

Up to 10 of the most relevant pages are synthesized into the final `install.md` file. Hidden pages and pages excluded from indexing are automatically filtered out.

## Custom install.md

To add a custom `install.md` file, create an `install.md` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file will override the automatically generated file. If you delete the custom file, the default generated file will be used again.

Your custom `install.md` file should follow the task-oriented format with a conversational opening, clear objective, success criteria, and a TODO checklist to maximize effectiveness with AI agents.

## When install.md is not generated

Mintlify will skip generating an `install.md` file in these cases:

- Your documentation is private or requires authentication
- You have a custom `install.md` file at the root of your project
- No installation-related pages are found in your documentation
