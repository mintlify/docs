The `install.md` file is designed for autonomous AI agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, and Aider) to execute installation tasks without human intervention. Similar to how `llms.txt` helps AI systems understand your documentation structure, `install.md` provides actionable installation instructions optimized for AI agent execution.

Mintlify automatically generates an `install.md` file at the root of your project by aggregating installation-related documentation pages into a single, AI-optimized markdown file. This file is always up to date and requires zero maintenance.

View your `install.md` by appending `/install.md` to your documentation site's URL.

## How it works

Mintlify automatically identifies pages in your documentation that contain installation-related content by matching keywords in page paths and titles, including:

- `installation` or `install`
- `quickstart` or `quick-start`
- `getting-started` or `getting_started`
- `setup` or `set-up`
- `introduction` or `intro`
- `overview`

The system then synthesizes these pages into a task-oriented format designed for AI agents to execute autonomously. The generated content includes:

- **Conversational opening** - Signals this is a direct user request for the agent to execute
- **Objective statement** - Clear goal of what needs to be accomplished
- **Success condition** - Specific measurable outcome that proves successful installation
- **TODO checklist** - High-level tasks with markdown checkboxes for the agent to track
- **Detailed instructions** - Step-by-step commands and platform-specific guidance
- **Execution directive** - Triggers immediate autonomous action

## install.md structure

An `install.md` file is a plain Markdown file optimized for AI agent execution:

```mdx Example install.md
I want you to install [Product Name] for me. Execute all the steps below autonomously.

OBJECTIVE: Install and set up [Product Name]

DONE WHEN: [Product Name] is successfully installed and operational

## TODO

- [ ] Install the CLI globally using npm
- [ ] Verify installation with version check
- [ ] Run first command to confirm functionality

## Install the CLI

You need to install the CLI globally using npm:

\`\`\`bash
npm i -g product-cli
\`\`\`

## Verify Installation

You must verify the installation was successful:

\`\`\`bash
product-cli --version
\`\`\`

EXECUTE NOW: Complete the above TODO list to achieve: [Product Name] successfully installed and operational
```

This task-oriented approach allows AI agents to interpret the file as a mission to execute autonomously, rather than documentation to reference.

## What pages are included

The `install.md` file includes up to 10 of the most relevant installation-related pages from your documentation, prioritized by:

1. Exact matches for "install" or "installation" in path or title
2. Pages containing "installation" or "install" keywords
3. Quickstart and quick-start pages
4. Getting-started pages
5. Setup pages
6. Introduction and intro pages
7. Overview pages

Pages are automatically filtered to exclude:

- Hidden pages
- Pages marked as not indexable
- Pages in non-default versions or languages
- Private or authenticated documentation

## Custom files

To add a custom `install.md` file, create an `install.md` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file will override the automatically generated file. If you delete a custom file, the default file will be used again.

Your custom `install.md` file should follow the task-oriented format with:

- Conversational opening requesting autonomous execution
- Clear objective and success condition
- TODO checklist with markdown checkboxes
- Detailed step-by-step instructions
- Execution directive at the end
