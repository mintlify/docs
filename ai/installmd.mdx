The [install.md](https://www.installmd.org/) file provides task-oriented installation instructions for AI agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and ChatGPT. Unlike traditional documentation written for human readers, [install.md](https://www.installmd.org/) presents installation steps as direct commands that AI agents execute autonomously.

Mintlify automatically generates an `install.md` file at the root of your project by aggregating and synthesizing installation-related documentation pages. This file is always up to date and does not require maintenance.

View your `install.md` by appending `/install.md` to your documentation site's URL.

## How `install.md` works

Mintlify automatically identifies pages in your documentation that contain installation-related content by matching keywords in page paths and titles. Hidden pages and pages excluded from indexing are automatically filtered out.

- `installation` or `install`
- `quickstart` or `quick-start`
- `getting-started` or `getting_started`
- `setup` or `set-up`
- `introduction` or `intro`
- `overview`

Mintlify synthesizes these pages into a concise, task-oriented format optimized for AI agent execution.

1. Extracts all shell commands, URLs, and platform-specific instructions.
2. Reorganizes content into a clear objective with success criteria.
3. Presents steps as direct commands rather than passive documentation.
4. Includes a TODO checklist for agents to track progress.
5. Removes troubleshooting sections and optional features to focus on the core installation path.

Mintlify does not generate an `install.md` file when:

- Your documentation is private or requires authentication.
- You have a custom `install.md` file at the root of your project.
- No installation-related pages are found in your documentation.

## `install.md` structure

An `install.md` file is a plain Markdown file that contains:

- **Conversational opening**: Frames the content as a user request to trigger autonomous execution.
- **Objective statement**: Clear goal of what needs to be installed.
- **Success condition**: Specific measurable outcome that proves successful installation.
- **TODO checklist**: High-level tasks.
- **Detailed instructions**: Step-by-step commands with all necessary shell commands.
- **Execution directive**: Closing statement that triggers immediate action.

## Custom `install.md`

To add a custom `install.md` file, create an `install.md` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file overrides the automatically generated file. If you delete the custom file, Mintlify generates a new `install.md` file.

Your custom `install.md` file should follow the task-oriented format with a conversational opening, clear objective, success criteria, and a TODO checklist to maximize effectiveness with AI agents.
