The [install.md](https://www.installmd.org/) file provides task-oriented installation instructions for AI agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and ChatGPT. Unlike traditional documentation written for human readers, [install.md](https://www.installmd.org/) presents installation steps as direct commands that AI agents execute autonomously.

Mintlify automatically generates an `install.md` file at the root of your project by aggregating and synthesizing installation-related documentation pages. This file is always up to date and does not require maintenance.

View your `install.md` by appending `/install.md` to your documentation site's URL.

## How `install.md` works

Mintlify automatically identifies pages in your documentation that contain installation-related content by matching keywords in page paths and titles. Hidden pages and pages excluded from indexing are automatically filtered out.

- `installation` or `install`
- `quickstart` or `quick-start`
- `getting-started` or `getting_started`
- `setup` or `set-up`
- `introduction` or `intro`
- `overview`

Mintlify synthesizes these pages into a concise, task-oriented format optimized for AI agent execution.

1. Extracts all shell commands, URLs, and platform-specific instructions.
2. Reorganizes content into a clear objective with success criteria.
3. Presents steps as direct commands rather than passive documentation.
4. Includes a TODO checklist for agents to track progress.
5. Removes troubleshooting sections and optional features to focus on the core installation path.

Mintlify does not generate an `install.md` file when:

- Your documentation is private or requires authentication.
- You have a custom `install.md` file at the root of your project.
- No installation-related pages are found in your documentation.

## `install.md` structure

An `install.md` file is a plain Markdown file that contains:

- **Conversational opening**: Frames the content as a user request to trigger autonomous execution.
- **Objective statement**: Clear goal of what needs to be installed.
- **Success condition**: Specific measurable outcome that proves successful installation.
- **TODO checklist**: High-level tasks.
- **Detailed instructions**: Step-by-step commands with all necessary shell commands.
- **Execution directive**: Closing statement that triggers immediate action.

## Custom `install.md`

To add a custom `install.md` file, create an `install.md` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file overrides the automatically generated file. If you delete the custom file, Mintlify generates a new `install.md` file.

Your custom `install.md` file should follow the task-oriented format with a conversational opening, clear objective, success criteria, and a TODO checklist to maximize effectiveness with AI agents.

## Best practices for install.md

Follow these guidelines to create effective installation instructions for AI agents:

### Write for autonomous execution

AI agents execute commands without human intervention. Structure your instructions to be:

- **Deterministic**: Each step should have one clear outcome
- **Self-contained**: Include all necessary context within the instruction
- **Verifiable**: Provide commands that confirm successful completion

```markdown
# Good: Specific and verifiable
Run `npm install` and verify success by checking that `node_modules` directory exists.

# Bad: Vague and unverifiable
Install the dependencies.
```

### Include environment prerequisites

Specify exact versions and system requirements at the start:

```markdown
## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm 9.0 or higher
- macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
```

### Provide fallback commands

Include alternative commands for different environments:

```markdown
## Install dependencies

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install
```

```bash yarn
yarn install
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```
</CodeGroup>
```

### Define clear success criteria

End each major section with a verification step:

```markdown
## Verify installation

Run the following command to confirm the installation succeeded:

\`\`\`bash
your-cli --version
\`\`\`

Expected output: `your-cli v1.0.0`
```

## Supported AI agents

The `install.md` format is optimized for these AI coding assistants:

| Agent | How it uses install.md |
|-------|----------------------|
| Claude Code | Reads install.md when asked to set up a project |
| Cursor | Accesses install.md through its documentation context |
| ChatGPT | Parses install.md when provided as context |
| GitHub Copilot | References install.md for installation guidance |
| Windsurf | Uses install.md for automated project setup |

## Example install.md

Here's a complete example of an effective `install.md` file:

```markdown
I need you to install and configure the Acme SDK in my project.

## Objective
Install the Acme SDK and configure it for API access.

## Success condition
The command `acme status` returns "Connected to Acme API".

## TODO
- [ ] Install the Acme SDK
- [ ] Configure API credentials
- [ ] Verify the connection

## Instructions

### Step 1: Install the SDK

\`\`\`bash
npm install @acme/sdk
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Configure credentials

Create a `.env` file with your API key:

\`\`\`bash
echo "ACME_API_KEY=your-api-key" > .env
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Verify connection

\`\`\`bash
npx acme status
\`\`\`

Begin installation now.
```

## Troubleshooting

### install.md not generating

If your `install.md` file isn't being generated:

1. Verify your documentation is publicly accessible
2. Check that you have pages with installation-related keywords in their paths or titles
3. Ensure pages aren't excluded via `mintignore` or marked as hidden

### Content not updating

The `install.md` file regenerates on each deployment. If content seems stale:

1. Trigger a new deployment from the Mintlify dashboard
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Verify the source pages have been updated
