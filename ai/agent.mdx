<Info>
  The agent is available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent).
</Info>

The agent creates pull requests with proposed documentation changes based on your prompts. It references your documentation, connected repositories, and Slack messages to create content following technical writing best practices. Access it via dashboard, Slack, or API.

Use the agent to:

- Write new content from prompts, PR links, or Slack threads
- Update outdated code examples and API references
- Search and update existing content

## Use the agent in the dashboard

Access the agent with <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or click **Ask agent**.

The agent panel has three views: **Chat** (send prompts), **History** (browse past conversations), and **Settings** (configure integrations).

<Tip>
  Start a new conversation for each task to keep context focused.
</Tip>

## Add the agent to Slack

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval, ask them to approve the Mintlify app first.
</Note>

1. Open the agent panel and click **Settings**.

    </Frame>
1. In the Slack integration section, click **Connect**.
1. Follow the Slack prompts to add the `mintlify` app and link your account.
1. Test by sending a DM or mentioning `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Connect your GitHub account

By default, PRs are attributed to the Mintlify bot. To attribute PRs to you, connect your GitHub account on the [My profile](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account) page.

## Connect repositories as context

Configure which repositories the agent can access in the agent panel **Settings** or in the [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Customize agent behavior

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository to customize the agent's behavior. The agent reads this file and follows your instructions for all tasks.

The agent checks the documentation directory first, then the repository root.

```markdown Example AGENTS.md file
# Documentation agent instructions

## Code examples
- Use TypeScript for all code examples.
- Always include error handling in API call examples.

## Style and formatting
- Write for developers with 2-5 years of experience.
- Use active voice and second person ("you").
```

## Embed the agent via API

Use the agent endpoints to [create jobs](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job), [get a specific job](/api-reference/agent/get-agent-job), and [get all jobs](/api-reference/agent/get-all-jobs).

Set `asDraft: false` to create non-draft pull requests ready for immediate review.

## Write effective prompts

Give clear, specific instructions. Break complex projects into smaller steps.

Try outcome-focused prompts:

- `@mintlify Users have trouble installing the CLI. Update the onboarding page to make CLI installation clearer.`
- `@mintlify Developers keep getting 401 errors. Add clearer examples showing how to format the API key.`

Use broad prompts for maintenance:

- `@mintlify Find and fix all typos in the docs`

## Specify a domain name

For multiple documentation sites, use `@mintlify subdomain=<your-domain-name> <your-prompt>` to target a specific site.

Find your domain name in your dashboard URL: `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/org-name/domain-name`

## Agent workflows

### Iterate in a Slack thread

Prompt the agent, then continue mentioning `@mintlify` in the same thread to refine the PR.

### Start with the agent, finish manually

Prompt the agent to begin, then checkout the branch to complete the task locally.

### Update docs when merging features

Share a PR link: `@mintlify This PR adds a new auth method. Update the docs: [PR link]`

### Generate release notes

`@mintlify Generate release notes for this PR: [PR link]`

### Generate code examples

`@mintlify Generate a code example for the authentication method`

### Review existing content

`@mintlify Review the API rate limiting section. We changed limits last month.`

### Automate with the API

Integrate the agent into automation tools. Learn how in the [Auto-update documentation when code is merged](/guides/automate-agent) tutorial.
