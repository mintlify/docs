<Info>
  Agent is available to anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

Agent can help you write and maintain documentation. It integrates with your Slack workspace and can reference your documentation, the Mintlify schema, and technical writing best practices to help with writing tasks. The agent can also be accessed through the API.

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, links to pull requests, or Slack threads
- Update outdated code examples and API references
- Search and update existing content
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics

To get started, add the agent to your Slack workspace and mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Add Agent to your Slack workspace

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the TODO: (confirm app name) MintlifyWriter app before you add it.
</Note>
TODO: confirm steps
1. Navigate to the [agent](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/agent) page of your dashboard.
2. Select **Connect** in the Slack card.
3. Follow the Slack prompts to add the app to your workspace.
4. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
  - Send a direct message to it.
  - Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Embed the agent via API

## Tips for working with Agent

Think of the agent as a helpful assistant that needs your guidance to complete tasks. Give it clear instructions and context. More focused tasks are easier to complete, so break down complex projects into smaller steps.

### Write effective prompts

Make your prompts specific and outcome-focused.

A prompt like `@mintlify Improve the onboarding page` will get general technical writing best practices applied to the page, but it doesn't have success criteria and it won't address a specific user need.

Try prompts based on outcomes you want your users to achieve or problems that you know they encounter. For example: `@mintlify A lot of users have trouble installing the CLI. Review the onboarding page and update the docs so that users can easily install the CLI.`

Use broad prompts for general content maintenance like fixing typos, updating redirects, or renaming a feature throughout your docs.

### Common workflows

Three common workflows to successfully use the agent are:
- Iterate on a prompt in a Slack thread
- Begin with the agent then take over in your local environment or the web editor
- Update docs when merging feature changes

You can prompt the agent, then continue to mention it with `@mintlify` in the same thread to refine and iterate on the pull request that it creates.

You can also query the agent to begin a project, then check out the branch it creates and finish the task in your local environment or the web editor. The agent can help you get started, then
you can take over to complete the task.

When you merge a feature PR, mention the agent with the PR link to automatically update relevant documentation. For example: `@mintlify This PR adds a new authentication method. Update the API
  docs to include the new auth flow: [PR link]`

This adds the PR-triggered pattern while keeping the existing workflows intact.
