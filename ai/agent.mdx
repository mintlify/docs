<Info>
  Agent is available to anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

Agent helps you write and maintain documentation. It can reference your documentation, GitHub repositories that you give it access to, pull requests, Slack messages, the Mintlify schema, and technical writing best practices. The agent integrates with your Slack workspace and can be embedded in custom applications with the API.

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, links to pull requests, or Slack threads
- Revise outdated code examples and API references
- Search and update existing content
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics

To get started, add the agent to your Slack workspace and mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Add Agent to your Slack workspace

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the TODO: (confirm app name) MintlifyWriter app before you add it.
</Note>
TODO: confirm steps
1. Navigate to the [agent](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/agent) page of your dashboard.
2. Select **Connect** in the Slack card.
3. Follow the Slack prompts to add the app to your workspace.
4. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
  - Send a direct message to it.
  - Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Embed the agent via API

## Tips for working with Agent

Think of the agent as a helpful assistant that needs your guidance to complete tasks. Give it clear instructions and context. More focused tasks are easier to complete, so break down complex projects into smaller steps.

### Write effective prompts

Make your prompts specific and outcome-focused.

A prompt like `@mintlify Improve the onboarding page` will get general technical writing best practices applied to the page, but it doesn't have success criteria and it won't address a specific user need.

Try prompts based on outcomes you want your users to achieve or problems that you know they encounter. For example: `@mintlify A lot of users have trouble installing the CLI. Review the onboarding page and update the docs so that users can easily install the CLI.`

Use broad prompts for general content maintenance like fixing typos, updating redirects, or renaming a feature throughout your docs.


From Claude: Consider adding one more example of a outcome-focused prompt for a different scenario (maybe API documentation or troubleshooting content)

### Common workflows

**Iterate on a prompt in a Slack thread**
You can prompt the agent, then continue to mention it with `@mintlify` in the same thread to refine and iterate on the pull request that it creates. For example: `@mintlify Our quickstart page needs a new section on inviting collaborators` then `@mintlify The new section should be called "Inviting collaborators"` and any other iterations.

**Begin with the agent then take over in your local environment or the web editor**
You can also query the agent to begin a project, then check out the branch it creates and finish the task in your local environment or the web editor. The agent can help you get started, then you can take over to complete the task. For example: `@mintlify Update the quickstart page to include information about inviting collaborators` and then checkout the branch to make any additional changes using your preferred method.

**Update docs when merging feature changes**
When you merge a feature PR, mention the agent with the PR link to automatically update relevant documentation. For example: `@mintlify This PR adds a new authentication method. Update the API docs to include the new auth flow: [PR link]`.

**Generate release notes from commit history**
Mention the agent with a specific PR or a time period to generate release notes or changelog updates based on the commit history. For example: `@mintlify Generate release notes for this PR: [PR link]`.

**Generate code examples**
Generate code examples for features or endpoints. For example: `@mintlify Generate a code example to make the authentication method easier to understand`.

TODO: could be more specific about when/why this helps users

1. Add a workflow about reviewing existing content for accuracy: @mintlify Review the API rate limiting section - we changed limits last month

2. Consider adding troubleshooting prompts: @mintlify Users are getting confused by step 3 in the setup guide. Make it clearer

**Automate with the API**
Integrate the agent into your existing automation tools to automatically update documentation when code changes occur, trigger content reviews, or sync documentation updates across multiple repositories.
