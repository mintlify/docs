<Info>
  The agent is available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) for anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

The agent creates pull requests with proposed changes to your documentation based on your prompts. When you send a request to the agent, it references your documentation, connected repositories, and Slack messages to create content that follows technical writing best practices and adheres to the Mintlify schema. Access the agent directly in your dashboard, in your Slack workspace, or embed it in custom applications with the API.

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, links to pull requests, or Slack threads
- Revise outdated code examples and API references
- Search and update existing content
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics

## Use the agent in the dashboard

Access the agent in a from your dashboard using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or by clicking the **Ask agent** button. The agent panel is resizable on desktop. On mobile devices, the agent opens in full-screen.

The agent panel has three views.

- **Chat**: Send prompts to the agent to update your documentation. The agent creates pull requests based on your instructions and displays links to view the pull requests or open the changes in the web editor.
- **History**: Browse past conversations and continue working on previous requests. Click any conversation to load it in the chat view.
- **Settings**: Configure the agent's integrations and repository access.

<Tip>
  Start a new conversation with the agent for each task. This keeps the agent's context focused and helps you associate conversations with specific projects.
</Tip>

## Add the agent to your Slack workspace

Use the agent in Slack to collaborate with your team on documentation updates.

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify app before you connect it.
</Note>

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard. 
1. Click the **Settings** button.
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-light.png" alt="The settings button in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-dark.png" alt="The settings button in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. In the Slack integration section, click **Connect**.
1. Follow the Slack prompts to add the `mintlify` app to your workspace.
1. Follow the Slack prompts to link your Mintlify account to your Slack workspace.
1. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
   - Send a direct message to it.
   - Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Connect your GitHub account

By default, the agent opens pull requests attributed to the Mintlify bot. To attribute pull requests to you, connect your GitHub account on the [My profile](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account) page of the dashboard.

## Connect repositories as context

The agent can only access repositories that you connect through the Mintlify GitHub App. Configure which repositories the agent can access in the agent panel **Settings** or in the [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Customize agent behavior

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository to customize the agent's behavior (`Agents.md` is also accepted). The agent reads this file and follows any instructions you provide.

The agent searches for `AGENTS.md` files in two locations. It first checks the documentation directory, then the repository root. If you have `AGENTS.md` files in both locations, the agent uses the file in your documentation directory.

Add any instructions that you want the agent to follow. The agent appends these instructions to its system prompt, so the instructions apply to all tasks, whether you use the agent in your dashboard, on Slack, or via the API.

# Documentation agent instructions

## Code examples
- Use TypeScript for all code examples. Our users are primarily TypeScript developers.
- Always include error handling in API call examples.
- Show both success and error response examples for all endpoints.
- Include import statements at the top of code examples.

## API documentation standards
- Every endpoint must document: authentication requirements, rate limits, and common error codes.
- Use real-world parameter values in examples (not foo/bar placeholders).
- Include a complete request/response cycle for each endpoint.

## Style and formatting
- Write for developers with 2-5 years of experience. Don't oversimplify, but explain non-obvious concepts.
- Use active voice and second person ("you").
- Date format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).
- When referencing UI elements, use bold: **Settings** button.

## What to include
- Add prerequisite sections to guides when users need API keys, environment setup, or dependencies.
- Include "Next steps" sections linking to related documentation.
- Add troubleshooting sections for common issues we see in support tickets.
```

## Embed the agent via API

Use the agent endpoints to [create jobs](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job), [get a specific job](/api-reference/agent/get-agent-job), and [get all jobs](/api-reference/agent/get-all-jobs).

When creating jobs via the API, you can control whether pull requests are created in draft mode using the `asDraft` parameter (defaults to `true`). Set `asDraft: false` to create non-draft pull requests ready for immediate review and merging in automated workflows.

## Write effective prompts

Think of the agent as a helpful assistant that needs your guidance to complete tasks. Give it clear instructions and context. More focused tasks are easier to complete, so break down complex projects into smaller steps.

Make your prompts specific and outcome-focused. Generic prompts like `@mintlify Improve the onboarding page` apply general best practices, but may not improve content in the specific way that you were picturing.

Try prompts based on outcomes you want your users to achieve or problems that they encounter. For example:

- `@mintlify A lot of users have trouble installing the CLI. Review the onboarding page and update the docs so that users can easily install the CLI`
- `@mintlify Developers keep getting 401 errors when following our authentication guide. Review the auth docs and add clearer examples showing how to properly format the API key`

Use broad prompts for general content maintenance like fixing typos, updating redirects, or renaming a feature throughout your docs. For example:

- `@mintlify Find and fix all typos in the docs`
- `@mintlify change all unordered lists to use * instead of -`

## Specify a domain name

If you have multiple documentation sites, include the `subdomain` parameter in your message to specify which documentation set the agent should work on.

To find your domain name, look at your dashboard URL for the documentation set you want to update. The domain name is the last part after your organization name. For example, if your dashboard URL is `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/org-name/domain-name`, your domain name is `domain-name`.

Use the format `@mintlify subdomain=<your-domain-name> <your-prompt>` to prompt the agent to work on a specific documentation set.

Examples:

- `@mintlify subdomain=public-docs Add a new section to the quickstart about inviting collaborators based on this PR`: Prompts the agent to update the quickstart only on the `public-docs` site.
- `@mintlify subdomain=customer-docs Update the auth docs for the new authentication method`: Prompts the agent to update the auth docs only on the `customer-docs` site.

## Agent workflows

The agent assists with many different documentation tasks. These workflows show some of the ways you can integrate the agent into your documentation process. Try an approach that fits how your team currently works and adapt it to your specific needs.

### Iterate on a prompt in a Slack thread

Prompt the agent, then continue to mention it with `@mintlify` in the same thread to refine and iterate on the pull request that it creates.

For example: `@mintlify Our quickstart page needs a new section on inviting collaborators`. Then `@mintlify The new section should be called "Inviting collaborators"`. Followed by any other iterations.

### Start with the agent, finish manually

Prompt the agent to begin a project, then check out the branch it creates and finish the task in your local environment or the web editor. The agent can help you get started, then you can take over to complete the task.

For example: `@mintlify Update the quickstart page to include information about inviting collaborators` and then checkout the branch to make any additional changes using your preferred method.

### Update docs when merging feature changes

When you merge a feature pull request, share the PR link with the agent to update relevant docs.

For example: `@mintlify This PR adds a new authentication method. Update the docs to include the new auth flow: [PR link]`.

### Generate release notes from a pull request

Prompt the agent with a specific pull request to generate release notes or changelog updates based on the commit history.

For example: `@mintlify Generate release notes for this PR: [PR link]`.

### Generate code examples

Prompt the agent to generate code examples for features throughout your docs or on specific pages.

For example: `@mintlify Generate a code example to make the authentication method easier to understand`.

### Review existing content

Prompt the agent to review existing content for technical accuracy, style, grammar, or other issues.

For example: `@mintlify Review the API rate limiting section. We changed limits last month`.

### Respond to user feedback

Prompt the agent with feedback from your users to make focused updates to your docs.

For example: `@mintlify Users are getting confused by step 3 in the setup guide. What might be making it unclear?`.

### Automate with the API

Integrate the agent into your existing automation tools to automatically update documentation when code changes occur, trigger content reviews, or sync documentation updates across multiple repositories.
