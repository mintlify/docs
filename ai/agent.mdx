<Info>
  The agent is available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) for anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

The agent creates pull requests with proposed changes to your documentation based on your prompts. When you send a request to the agent, it references your documentation, connected repositories, and Slack messages to create content that follows technical writing best practices and adheres to the Mintlify schema. Access the agent in your Slack workspace or embed it in custom applications with the API.

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, links to pull requests, or Slack threads
- Revise outdated code examples and API references
- Search and update existing content
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics

To get started, add the agent to your Slack workspace and mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Add the agent to your Slack workspace

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify app before you connect it.
</Note>

1. Navigate to the [agent](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/agent) page of your dashboard.
2. Select the **Connect** button.
3. Follow the Slack prompts to add the `mintlify` app to your workspace.
4. Follow the Slack prompts to link your Mintlify account to your Slack workspace.
5. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
   - Send a direct message to it.
   - Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Connect repositories as context

The agent can only access repositories that you connect through the Mintlify GitHub App. Modify which repositories the agent can access in the [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Embed the agent via API

Use the agent endpoints to [create jobs](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job), [get a specific job](/api-reference/agent/get-agent-job), and [get all jobs](/api-reference/agent/get-all-jobs).

## Write effective prompts

Think of the agent as a helpful assistant that needs your guidance to complete tasks. Give it clear instructions and context. More focused tasks are easier to complete, so break down complex projects into smaller steps.

Make your prompts specific and outcome-focused. Generic prompts like `@mintlify Improve the onboarding page` apply general best practices, but may not improve content in the specific way that you were picturing.

Try prompts based on outcomes you want your users to achieve or problems that they encounter. For example:

- `@mintlify A lot of users have trouble installing the CLI. Review the onboarding page and update the docs so that users can easily install the CLI`
- `@mintlify Developers keep getting 401 errors when following our authentication guide. Review the auth docs and add clearer examples showing how to properly format the API key`

Use broad prompts for general content maintenance like fixing typos, updating redirects, or renaming a feature throughout your docs. For example:

- `@mintlify Find and fix all typos in the docs`
- `@mintlify change all unordered lists to use * instead of -`

## Specify a subdomain

If you have multiple documentation sites with their own subdomains, include the `subdomain` parameter in your message to specify which subdomain the agent should work on.

Use the format `@mintlify subdomain=<your-subdomain> <your-prompt>` to prompt the agent to work on a specific subdomain.

Examples:

- `@mintlify subdomain=public-docs Add a new section to the quickstart about inviting collaborators based on this PR`: Prompts the agent to update the quickstart only on the `public-docs` subdomain.
- `@mintlify subdomain=customer-docs Update the auth docs for the new authentication method`: Prompts the agent to update the auth docs only on the `customer-docs` subdomain.

## Agent workflows

The agent assists with many different documentation tasks. These workflows show some of the ways you can integrate the agent into your documentation process. Try an approach that fits how your team currently works and adapt it to your specific needs.

### Iterate on a prompt in a Slack thread

Prompt the agent, then continue to mention it with `@mintlify` in the same thread to refine and iterate on the pull request that it creates.

For example: `@mintlify Our quickstart page needs a new section on inviting collaborators`. Then `@mintlify The new section should be called "Inviting collaborators"`. Followed by any other iterations.

### Start with the agent, finish manually

Prompt the agent to begin a project, then check out the branch it creates and finish the task in your local environment or the web editor. The agent can help you get started, then you can take over to complete the task.

For example: `@mintlify Update the quickstart page to include information about inviting collaborators` and then checkout the branch to make any additional changes using your preferred method.

### Update docs when merging feature changes

When you merge a feature pull request, share the PR link with the agent to update relevant docs.

For example: `@mintlify This PR adds a new authentication method. Update the docs to include the new auth flow: [PR link]`.

### Generate release notes from a pull request

Prompt the agent with a specific pull request to generate release notes or changelog updates based on the commit history.

For example: `@mintlify Generate release notes for this PR: [PR link]`.

### Generate code examples

Prompt the agent to generate code examples for features throughout your docs or on specific pages.

For example: `@mintlify Generate a code example to make the authentication method easier to understand`.

### Review existing content

Prompt the agent to review existing content for technical accuracy, style, grammar, or other issues.

For example: `@mintlify Review the API rate limiting section. We changed limits last month`.

### Respond to user feedback

Prompt the agent with feedback from your users to make focused updates to your docs.

For example: `@mintlify Users are getting confused by step 3 in the setup guide. What might be making it unclear?`.

### Automate with the API

Integrate the agent into your existing automation tools to automatically update documentation when code changes occur, trigger content reviews, or sync documentation updates across multiple repositories.
