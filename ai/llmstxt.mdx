The [llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) helps LLMs index content efficiently, similar to how sitemaps help search engines.

Mintlify automatically hosts an `llms.txt` file at your project root. View it by appending `/llms.txt` to your documentation URL.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt">Open the llms.txt for this site.</PreviewButton>

## llms.txt structure

A plain Markdown file containing:

- **Site title** as an H1 heading
- **Structured content sections** with links and descriptions

Pages are listed alphabetically. Descriptions come from the `description` field in frontmatter.

## Custom files

Add a custom `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` at your project root to override the auto-generated file. Your custom file must have a site title as an H1 heading. See [Format](https://llmstxt.org/#format) for best practices.
