The [llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps LLMs index content more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find content relevant to user queries.

Mintlify automatically hosts an `llms.txt` file at the root of your project that lists all available pages in your documentation. This file is always up to date and requires zero maintenance. You can optionally add a custom `llms.txt` file to the root of your project.

View your `llms.txt` by appending `/llms.txt` to your documentation site's URL.

## llms.txt structure

An `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file that contains:

- **Site title** as an H1 heading.
- **Structured content sections** with links and a description of each page in your documentation.

Pages are listed alphabetically in the order they appear in your repository, starting from the root directory.

Each page's description comes from the `description` field in its frontmatter. Pages without a `description` field appear in the `llms.txt` file without a description.

```mdx Example llms.txt
# Site title

## Docs

- [API](https://example.com/docs/api): Endpoint list and usage
- [Install](https://example.com/docs/install): Setup steps
- [Getting started](https://example.com/docs/start): Intro guide
```

This structured approach allows LLMs to efficiently process your documentation at a high level and locate relevant content for user queries, improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted documentation searches.

## llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools and is indexed by LLM traffic.

Mintlify automatically hosts an `llms-full.txt` file at the root of your project. View your `llms-full.txt` by appending `/llms-full.txt` to your documentation site's URL.

## Custom files

To add a custom `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` file, create an `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file will override the automatically generated file of the same name. If you delete a custom file, the default file will be used again.

Your custom `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` file must have a site title as an H1 heading. Other content is optional. See [Format](https://llmstxt.org/#format) in the `llms.txt` specification for more information on optional sections and best practices.
