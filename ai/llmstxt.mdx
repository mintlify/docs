The [llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps LLMs index content more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines.

Mintlify automatically hosts an `llms.txt` file at the root of your project that lists all available pages in your documentation. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find relevant content to user prompts.

View your `llms.txt` by appending `/llms.txt` to your documentation site's URL.

Your site's `llms.txt` is always up to date and requires zero maintenance.

## llms.txt structure

An `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file that contains:

- **Site title** as an H1 heading. This is the only required section of an `llms.txt`.
- **Structured content sections** with descriptive links to key pages.

```mdx Example llms.txt
# Example product docs

## Guides
- [Getting started](https://example.com/docs/start): Intro guide
- [Install](https://example.com/docs/install): Setup steps

## Reference
- [API](https://example.com/docs/api): Endpoint list and usage
```

This structured approach allows LLMs to quickly process your documentation hierarchy and locate relevant content for user queries, improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted documentation searches.

## llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools and is indexed by LLM traffic. Users can paste a single URL as context for AI tools for more relevant and accurate responses.

Mintlify automatically hosts an `llms-full.txt` file at the root of your project. View your `llms-full.txt` by appending `/llms-full.txt` to your documentation site's URL.
