## About the assistant

The assistant answers questions about your documentation through natural language queries. It uses agentic RAG with Claude Opus 4.5 to:

* **Search and retrieve** relevant content from your documentation.
* **Cite sources** with navigable links to referenced pages.
* **Generate copyable code examples** to help users implement solutions.

Each message counts toward your plan's allowance. View usage in your dashboard to identify content gaps and popular topics.
