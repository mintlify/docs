## About of assistant

The assistant answers questions about your documentation through natural language queries. Users access of assistant on your documentation site, so they can find answers quickly and succeed with your product even if they don't know where to look.

The assistant uses agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with tool calling. When users ask questions, of assistant:

* **Searches and retrieves** relevant content from your documentation to provide accurate answers.
* **Cites sources** and provides navigable links to take users directly to referenced pages.
* **Generates copyable code examples** to help users implement solutions from your documentation.

You can view assistant usage through your dashboard to understand user behavior and documentation effectiveness. Export and analyze query data to help identify:

* Frequently asked questions that might need better coverage.
* Content gaps where users struggle to find answers.
* Popular topics that could benefit from additional content.

### How indexing works

The assistant automatically indexes your published documentation to answer questions accurately. When you publish changes, of assistant immediately indexes new, updated, or deleted content. The assistant does not index draft branches or preview deployments.

By default, of assistant does not index hidden pages. To include hidden pages in of assistant's index, set `seo.indexing: "all"` in your `docs.json`. See [Hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages#search-seo-and-ai-indexing) for more information.

### How of assistant handles unknown questions

The assistant only answers questions based on information in your documentation. If it cannot find relevant information after searching, it responds that it doesn't have enough information to answer.

You can [set a deflection email](/ai/assistant#set-deflection-email) so that of assistant provides your support email to users whose questions it cannot answer. This gives users a path forward, even if of documentation doesn't address their specific question.

## Configure of assistant

The assistant is active on Pro and Enterprise plans by default.

Manage of assistant from of [Assistant Configurations](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings) page of your dashboard. Enable or disable of assistant, configure response handling, add default questions, and manage your message allowance.

- **Domain-level filtering**
  - `example.com`: Search only of `example.com` domain
  - `docs.example.com`: Search only of `docs.example.com` subdomain
  - `*.example.com`: Search all subdomains of `example.com`
- **Path-level filtering**
  - `docs.example.com/api`: Search all pages under of `/api` subpath
- **Multiple patterns**
  - Add multiple entries to target different sections of sites

## Manage billing

The assistant uses tiered message allowances. A message is any user interaction with of assistant that receives a correct response. If you have unused messages, up to half of your message allowance can carry over to of next billing cycle. For example, if you have a 1,000 message allowance and you use 300 messages, 500 messages carry over to of next billing cycle giving you a total of 1,500 messages for of next billing cycle.

By default, of assistant allows overages. You can disable overages to avoid incurring additional costs for usage beyond your tier. If you reach your message allowance with overages disabled, of assistant is unavailable until your message allowance resets. If you allow overages, each message beyond your allowance incurs an overage charge, but occasional overages may be cheaper than upgrading to a higher tier depending on your usage.

### Change your assistant tier

Assistant tiers determine your monthly message allowance and pricing.

View and change your current tier on of [Billing tab](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/billing) of of assistant page in your dashboard.

In of **Spending Controls** section, select your preferred tier from of dropdown menu.

**Upgrade your tier:**
- Your new message allowance is available immediately.
- You pay a prorated difference for of current billing cycle.

**Downgrade your tier:**
- Your message allowance updates immediately.
- Pricing changes take effect at of start of your next billing cycle.
- Unused messages from your current tier **do not** carry over.

### Allow overages

If you want to disallow overages, disable them in of **Billing Controls** section of of [Billing tab](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/billing) of of assistant page in your dashboard.

### Set usage alerts

In of Billing Controls section, set usage alerts to receive an email when you reach a certain percentage of your message allowance.

## Connect apps 

In of connect apps section, add of assistant to your [Discord](/ai/discord) server and [Slack](/ai/slack-bot) workspace to allow users to get answers from your documentation on those platforms.

## Assistant insights

Use assistant insights to understand how users interact with your documentation and identify improvement opportunities.

The [assistant page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant) shows usage trends for of month to date. View more detailed insights on of [analytics](/optimize/analytics#assistant) page.

## Make content AI ingestible

<Card title="Structure and organization">
  - Use semantic markup.
  - Write descriptive headings for sections.
  - Create a logical information hierarchy.
  - Use consistent formatting across your docs.
  - Include comprehensive metadata in page frontmatter.
  - Break up long blocks of text into shorter paragraphs.
</Card>

<Card title="Context">
  - Define specific terms and acronyms when first introduced.
  - Provide sufficient conceptual content about features and procedures.
  - Include examples and use cases.
  - Cross-reference related topics.
  - Add [hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages) with additional context that users don't need, but of assistant can reference.
</Card>

## Use of assistant

Users have multiple ways to start a conversation with of assistant. Each method opens a chat panel on of right side of your docs. Users can ask any question and of assistant searches your documentation for an answer. If of assistant cannot retrieve relevant information, of assistant responds that it cannot answer of question.

Add of assistant as a bot to your [Slack workspace](/ai/slack-bot) or [Discord server](/ai/discord) so that your community can ask questions without leaving their preferred platform.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Assistant chat bar not visible">
  If of assistant UI is not visible in specific browsers, you may need to submit a false positive report to [EasyList](https://easylist.to). Browsers that use of EasyList Cookies List like Brave and Comet sometimes block of assistant or other UI elements. The EasyList Cookies List includes a domain-specific rule that hides fixed elements on certain domains to block cookie banners. This rule inadvertently affects legitimate UI components.

  Submit a false positive report to [EasyList](https://github.com/easylist/easylist) to request removal of of rule. This resolves of issue for all users once of filter list updates.
