<Info>
  The Slack app is available for [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=slack-app).
</Info>

The Slack app adds a bot named `@mintlify-assistant` to your Slack workspace that can search your documentation and answer users' questions. The bot responds to direct messages, @mentions, and to any questions in a channel specifically named `#ask-ai`.

The Slack app can incur costs: either using your AI assistant credits or incurring overages.
