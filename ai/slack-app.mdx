<Info>
  The Slack app is available for [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=slack-app).
</Info>

The Slack app adds a bot to your Slack workspace that searches your documentation to answer users' questions. The bot responds when a user mentions it with the `@` symbol and to any messages in a channel specifically named `#ask-ai`.

Each message sent by the Slack app counts toward your plan's assistant message allowance.

## Set up the Slack app

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify Slack app before you add it.
</Note>

1. Navigate to the [Assistant Configurations](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings) page in your dashboard.

## Add the Slack bot to a channel
