<Info>
  The Slack app is available for [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=slack-app).
</Info>

The Slack app adds a bot to your workspace that supports your community with real-time answers. The bot is trained on your documentation, so it is always up-to-date and answers questions by directly citing your docs.

The bot responds when a user mentions it with the `@` symbol and to any messages in a channel specifically named `#ask-ai`.

Each message sent by the Slack app counts toward your plan's assistant message allowance.

## Set up the Slack app

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify Slack app before you add it.
</Note>

1. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/integrations) tab of the **Assistant Configurations** page in your dashboard.
1. In the Slack card, click **Connect**. This opens Slack.

1. Follow the Slack prompts to add the app to your workspace.
1. Mention the bot to add it to a channel. The bot's default name is TODO:

### Customize the bot's name

1. In Slack, select the Mintlify app in the **Apps** menu.
1. Click **About**.
1. Click **Configuration**. This opens the app configuration page in a web browser.

## Create an `#ask-ai` channel

To help your users quickly get answers to their questions, create a channel named `#ask-ai`. The bot will respond to every message in that channel. See [Create a channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel) in the Slack Help Center for more information.

## Manage the Slack app

After you add the app to your workspace, you can manage or remove the app from the [Integrations](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/integrations) tab.
