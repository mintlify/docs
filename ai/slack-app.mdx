<Info>
  The Slack app is available for [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=slack-app).
</Info>

The Slack app adds a bot named `@mintlify-assistant` to your Slack workspace that can search your documentation and answer users' questions. The bot responds to direct messages, @mentions, and to any questions in a channel specifically named `#ask-ai`.

The Slack app can incur costs: either using your AI assistant credits or incurring overages.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the [Slack app page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/slack) in your dashboard.
2. Click **Add to Slack**.
3. Follow the Slack prompts to add the app to your workspace.
4. Test that the bot is working and responds when you:
  - Send a direct message to the Mintlify app.
  - Mention the bot with `@mintlify-assistant` in a channel.
  - Create an `#ask-ai` channel, add the bot, and ask a question.
