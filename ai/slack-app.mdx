<Info>
  The Slack app is available for [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=slack-app).
</Info>

The Slack app adds a bot to your Slack workspace that can search your documentation and answer users' questions. The bot responds to direct messages, @mentions, and to any questions in a channel specifically named `#ask-ai`. The bot's name is `@yourprojectname-assistant`. So if your project name is Mintlify, the bot's name is `@mintlify-assistant`.

The Slack app can incur costs: either using your AI assistant credits or incurring overages.

## Set up the Slack app

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify Slack app before you add it.
</Note>

1. Navigate to the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard.
2. Select **Connect** in the Slack Integration card.
3. Follow the Slack prompts to add the app to your workspace.
4. Test that the bot is working and responds when you:
  - Send a direct message to the bot.
  - Mention the bot in a channel.
  - Create an `#ask-ai` channel, add the bot, and ask a question.
