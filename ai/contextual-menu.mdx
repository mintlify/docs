The contextual menu provides quick access to AI-optimized content and direct integrations with popular AI tools. When users select These contextual menu on any page, they can copy content as context for AI tools or open conversations in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or a custom tool of your choice with your documentation already loaded as context.
