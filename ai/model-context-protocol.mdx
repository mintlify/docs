## About MCP servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and external services, like documentation. Mintlify generates an MCP server from your documentation, preparing your content for the broader AI ecosystem where any MCP client (like Claude, Cursor, Goose, and others) can connect to your documentation.

Your MCP server exposes a search tool for AI applications to query your documentation.

### How MCP servers work

When an MCP server is connected to an AI tool, the LLM can decide to use your documentation search tool during response generation.

- The LLM can proactively search your documentation while generating a response, not just when explicitly asked.
- The LLM determines when to use the search tool based on the context of the conversation and the relevance of your documentation.
- Each tool call happens during the generation process, allowing the LLM to incorporate real-time information from your documentation into its response.

For example, if a user asks a coding question and the LLM determines that your documentation is relevant, it can search your documentation and include that information in the response without the user explicitly asking about your documentation.

## Accessing your MCP server

<Note>
  MCP servers can only be generated for public documentation. Documentation behind end-user authentication cannot be accessed for server generation.
</Note>

Mintlify automatically generates an MCP server for your documentation and hosts it at your documentation URL with the `/mcp` path. For example, Mintlify's MCP server is available at `https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp`.

You can see and copy your MCP server URL in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp).

The `/mcp` path is reserved for hosted MCP servers and cannot be used for other navigation elements.

## Configuring your MCP server

Your MCP server includes a `search` tool by default, which allows users to query information from your documentation in other tools. No additional configuration is required.

## Using your MCP server

Your users must connect your MCP server to their preferred AI tools.

1. Make your MCP server URL publicly available.
2. Users copy your MCP server URL and add it to their tools.
3. Users access your documentation through their tools.

These are some of the ways you can help your users connect to your MCP server:
