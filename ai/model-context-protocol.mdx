## About MCP servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and external services, like documentation. Mintlify generates an MCP server from your documentation, preparing your content for the broader AI ecosystem where any MCP client (like Claude, Cursor, Goose, and others) can connect to your documentation.

Your MCP server exposes a search tool for AI applications to query your documentation.

### How MCP servers work

When an AI tool like Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT has your documentation MCP server connected, the AI tool can search your documentation directly during response generation rather than doing a generic web search.

- The LLM can proactively search your documentation while generating a response, not just when explicitly asked.
- The LLM determines when to use the search tool based on the context of the conversation and the relevance of your documentation.
- Each tool call happens during the generation process, allowing the LLM to incorporate real-time information from your documentation into its response.

For example, if a user asks a coding question and the LLM determines that your documentation is relevant, it can search your documentation and include that information in the response without the user explicitly asking about your documentation.

## Access your MCP server

<Note>
  MCP servers are only available for public documentation. Documentation behind end-user authentication cannot generate an MCP server.
</Note>

Mintlify automatically generates an MCP server for your documentation and hosts it at your documentation URL with the `/mcp` path. For example, Mintlify's MCP server is available at `https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp`.

View and copy your MCP server URL on the [MCP server page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp) in your dashboard.

  <img src="/images/mcp/mcp-server-page-dark.png" alt="MCP server page in the dashboard." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Hosted MCP servers use the `/mcp` path in their URLs. Other navigation elements cannot use the `/mcp` path.
</Note>

## Use your MCP server

Your users must connect your MCP server to their preferred AI tools.

1. Make your MCP server URL publicly available.
2. Users copy your MCP server URL and add it to their tools.
3. Users access your documentation through their tools.

These are some of the ways you can help your users connect to your MCP server:
