## About MCP servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and external services, like documentation. Mintlify generates an MCP server from your documentation and OpenAPI specifications, preparing your content for the broader AI ecosystem where any MCP client (like Claude, Cursor, Goose, and others) can connect to your documentation and APIs. 

Your MCP server exposes tools and resources to AI applications:

- **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the AI application, including documentation search and API calls.
- **Resources**: Your documentation content, API responses, and other data.

This structure allows any MCP-compatible tool to understand and work with your documentation in a consistent way.

## Accessing your MCP server

<Note>
  MCP servers can only be generated for public documentation. Documentation behind end-user authentication cannot be accessed for server generation.
</Note>

Your MCP server is automatically generated and hosted at your documentation URL with the `/mcp` path.

For example, Mintlify's MCP server is available at `https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp`.

## Using your MCP server

Your users must connect your MCP server to their preferred AI tools. 

1. Make your MCP server URL publicly available.
2. Users copy your MCP server URL and add it to their tools.
3. The tools will have standardized access to your documentation and API endpoints.

### Claude

To use your MCP server with Claude:

1. Navigate to the [Connectors](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors) page in the Claude settings. 
2. Select **Add custom connector**.
3. Add your MCP server URL and select **Add**.
4. When using Claude, select the attachments button and select your MCP server to add it as context for your chat.

See the [Model Context Protocol documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/use-remote-mcp-server#connecting-to-a-remote-mcp-server) for more details about connecting Claude to a remote MCP server.

### Cursor

TODO:


## Authentication

When using API endpoints through your MCP server, AI tools will prompt users for their API keys as needed. These keys are handled directly by the tool and not stored or processed by Mintlify.

If a user asks their AI tool to demonstrate an API call, it will request the necessary authentication credentials from the user at that moment.

## Configuring your MCP server

All MCP servers include the `search` tool by default, allowing users to query information from your docs in other tools.

### Adding API functions

If you have an OpenAPI specification, you can expose specific endpoints as MCP tools by using the `x-mcp` extension at either the file or endpoint level.

For example, the Mintlify MCP server includes tools to get status updates, trigger updates, and create assistant chats.

#### File-level configuration

Enable MCP for all endpoints in an OpenAPI specification file:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "x-mcp": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  // Other OpenAPI content
}
```

#### Endpoint-level configuration

Enable MCP for specific endpoints only:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/api/v1/users": {
      "x-mcp": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      // Endpoint configuration
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring your MCP server

You can view all available MCP tools in the **Available tools** section of the [MCP Server page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp) in your dashboard.
