## About MCP servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and external services, like documentation. Mintlify generates an MCP server from your documentation and OpenAPI specifications, preparing your content for the broader AI ecosystem where any MCP client (like Claude, Cursor, Goose, and others) can connect to your documentation and APIs. 

Your MCP server exposes tools for AI applications to search your documentation and interact with your APIs.

## Accessing your MCP server

<Note>
  MCP servers can only be generated for public documentation. Documentation behind end-user authentication cannot be accessed for server generation.
</Note>

Your MCP server is automatically generated and hosted at your documentation URL with the `/mcp` path.

For example, Mintlify's MCP server is available at `https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp`.

## Configuring your MCP server

All MCP servers include the `search` tool by default, allowing users to query information from your docs in other tools.

If you have an OpenAPI specification, you can expose specific endpoints as MCP tools by using the `mcp` object within the `x-mint` extension at either the file or endpoint level. For example, the Mintlify MCP server includes tools to create assistant chats, get status updates, and trigger updates.

MCP servers follow a security-first approach where API endpoints are not exposed by default. You must explicitly enable endpoints to make them available as MCP tools. Only expose endpoints that are safe for public access through AI tools.

### File-level configuration

Enable MCP for all endpoints by default in an OpenAPI specification file and selectively exclude endpoints:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "x-mint": {
    "mcp": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  // ...
  "paths": {
    "/api/v1/users": {
      "get": {
        "x-mint": {
          "mcp": {
            "enabled": false // Disables MCP for this endpoint
          }
        },
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Endpoint-level configuration

Enable MCP for specific endpoints:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/api/v1/users": {
      "get": {
        "x-mint": {
          "mcp": {
            "enabled": true
          },
          // ...
        }
      }
    },
    "/api/v1/delete": {
      "delete": {
        // No `x-mint: mcp` so this endpoint is not exposed as an MCP tool
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using your MCP server

Your users must connect your MCP server to their preferred AI tools. 

1. Make your MCP server URL publicly available.
2. Users copy your MCP server URL and add it to their tools.
3. The tools will have standardized access to your documentation and API endpoints.

### Claude

To use your MCP server with Claude:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your MCP server to Claude">
    1. Navigate to the [Connectors](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors) page in the Claude settings. 
    2. Select **Add custom connector**.
    3. Add your MCP server name and URL.
    4. Select **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your MCP server in your chat">
    1. When using Claude, select the attachments button (the plus icon). 
    2. Select your MCP server.
    3. Query Claude with your MCP server as context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

See the [Model Context Protocol documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/use-remote-mcp-server#connecting-to-a-remote-mcp-server) for more details.

### Cursor

To connect your MCP server to Cursor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open MCP settings">
    1. Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Windows) to open the command palette.
    2. Search for "Open MCP settings".
    3. Select **Add custom MCP**. This will open the `mcp.json` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your server">
    In `mcp.json`, configure your server:

    ```json mcp.json example
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "server-name": {
          "url": "https://your-docs-site.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the connection">
    In Cursor's chat, you can ask "What tools do you have available?" Cursor should have your documentation search and any configured API endpoints.
  </Step>
</Steps>

See [Installing MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/mcp#installing-mcp-servers) in the Cursor documentation for more details.

## Authentication

When you enable an API endpoint for MCP, the server includes the authentication requirements defined in your OpenAPI `securitySchemes`. Any keys are handled directly by the tool and not stored or processed by Mintlify.

If a user asks their AI tool to call a protected endpoint, the tool will request the necessary authentication credentials from the user at that moment.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP server only shows search tool">
    If your MCP server only exposes the search tool despite having an OpenAPI specification:

    1. Verify your OpenAPI specification is valid and accessible.
    2. Ensure you've explicitly enabled MCP for specific endpoints using `x-mint.mcp.enabled: true`.
    3. Check your deployment logs for OpenAPI processing errors.

    If OpenAPI processing fails, the server continues with just the search tool to maintain functionality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication issues">
    If users report authentication problems:

    1. Check that your OpenAPI specification includes proper `securitySchemes` definitions.
    2. Confirm that enabled endpoints work with the specified authentication methods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tool descriptions missing or unclear">
    If AI tools aren't using your API endpoints effectively:

    1. Add detailed `summary` and `description` fields to your endpoints.
    2. Ensure parameter names and descriptions are self-explanatory.
    3. Use the MCP dashboard to verify how your endpoints appear as tools.
  </Accordion>

## Monitoring your MCP server

You can view all available MCP tools in the **Available tools** section of the [MCP Server page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp) in your dashboard.
