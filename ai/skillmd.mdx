The [skill.md](https://agentskills.io/) file provides a structured reference of your product's capabilities for AI agents. Following the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/), skill.md helps AI agents understand what they can accomplish with your product, including available APIs, features, workflows, and integrations.

Mintlify automatically generates a `skill.md` file at the root of your project by aggregating and synthesizing capability-related documentation pages. This file is always up to date and does not require maintenance.

View your `skill.md` by appending `/skill.md` to your documentation site's URL.

## How `skill.md` works

Mintlify automatically identifies pages in your documentation that contain capability-related content by analyzing your documentation structure and content. The system focuses on pages that describe APIs, features, workflows, and integration points.

Mintlify synthesizes these pages into a structured format optimized for AI agent discovery:

1. Extracts capabilities, skills, and workflows from your documentation.
2. Organizes content into standardized sections following the agentskills.io specification.
3. Preserves API endpoints, commands, and code examples.
4. Focuses on actionable information that helps agents understand what can be done.
5. Removes installation steps, troubleshooting, and marketing content.

Mintlify does not generate a `skill.md` file when:

- Your documentation is private or requires authentication.
- You have a custom `skill.md` file at the root of your project.
- No capability-related pages are found in your documentation.

## Content inclusion

The `skill.md` file respects your documentation's visibility settings:

- **Excluded content**: Pages marked with `noindex` or protected by authentication groups are automatically filtered out.
- **Public content only**: Only publicly accessible pages are included in the generated file.
- **Navigation structure**: Hidden pages that are not visible in your navigation are excluded.

## `skill.md` structure

A `skill.md` file is a plain Markdown file with YAML frontmatter that contains:

- **Frontmatter**: Metadata including product name, description, and version.
- **Capabilities**: Overview of what agents can accomplish with your product.
- **Skills**: Organized list of specific capabilities by category with descriptions and examples.
- **Workflows**: Common multi-step procedures with relevant commands and API calls.
- **Integration**: How your product connects with other tools and services.
- **Context**: Important domain knowledge agents need to use your product effectively.

```

## Custom `skill.md`

To add a custom `skill.md` file, create a `skill.md` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file overrides the automatically generated file. If you delete the custom file, Mintlify generates a new `skill.md` file.

Your custom `skill.md` file should follow the agentskills.io specification with clear sections for Capabilities, Skills, Workflows, Integration, and Context to maximize effectiveness with AI agents.

<Note>
Custom `skill.md` files marked with `noindex` or protected by authentication groups will not be served publicly. In these cases, Mintlify will fall back to AI-generated content.
