Mintlify hosts a `skill.md` file at the root of your project that describes what AI agents can do with your product.

The [skill.md specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) is a structured, machine-readable format that makes capabilities, required inputs, and constraints for products explicit so that agents can use them more reliably.

Mintlify automatically generates a `skill.md` file for your project by analyzing your documentation with an agentic loop. This file stays up to date as you make updates to your documentation and requires no maintenance. You can optionally add a custom `skill.md` file to the root of your project that overrides the automatically generated one.

View your `skill.md` by appending `/skill.md` to your documentation site's URL. Mintlify only generates `skill.md` files for documentation sites that are public.

<Tip>
Both `llms.txt` and `skill.md` files help agents work with your documentation, but they serve different purposes.

- `llms.txt` is a directory. It lists all your documentation pages with descriptions so agents know where to find information.
- `skill.md` is a capability summary. It tells agents what they can accomplish with your product, what inputs they need, and what constraints apply.
</Tip>

## Use `skill.md` files with agents

Agents can process your `skill.md` with the [skills CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills).

```bash
npx skills add yourdomain.com/docs/skill.md
```

This adds your product's capabilities to the agent's context so it can take actions on behalf of users.

<Tip>
  Teach your users how to use `skill.md` files with agents so that they have better results using your product with their AI tools.

## `skill.md` structure

Mintlify generates a `skill.md` file following the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). The generated file includes:

- **Metadata**: Project name, description, and version.
- **Capabilities**: What agents can accomplish with your product.
- **Skills**: Specific actions organized by category.
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step procedures for common tasks.
- **Integration**: Supported tools and services.
- **Context**: Background on your product's architecture.

## Custom `skill.md` files

Add a `skill.md` file to the root of your project to override the automatically generated file. If you delete a custom file, Mintlify generates a new `skill.md` file.

Write a custom file when you want precise control over how agents interact with your product. Follow the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) to ensure compatibility with agent tooling.
