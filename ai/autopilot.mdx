<Info>
  Autopilot is available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=autopilot) for anyone with access to your dashboard.

Autopilot automatically monitors your code repositories for merged pull requests and analyzes whether they require documentation updates. When documentation changes are needed, autopilot creates suggestions in your dashboard that you can review and act on.

## How autopilot works

When a pull request is merged in a repository you're watching:

1. Autopilot queues an analysis job for the merged PR
2. The agent analyzes the PR using a streaming agentic workflow with access to:
   - Your documentation repository files
   - The code repository files
   - The PR diff and metadata
3. If documentation updates are needed, autopilot creates a suggestion with a prompt describing what should be updated
4. You can review suggestions in your dashboard and use the agent to implement the changes

### Agentic analysis

Autopilot uses the same agentic workflow as the agent, with access to specialized tools:

- **list**: Browse files and directories in your documentation repository
- **read**: Read file contents from your documentation
- **read_navigation**: Understand your documentation structure and navigation
- **external_list**: Browse files in connected code repositories
- **external_read**: Read files from connected code repositories
- **fetch_pull_request**: Retrieve pull request details including diffs and metadata
- **generate_suggestion**: Create a documentation suggestion with a prompt

The agent determines whether a PR requires documentation updates based on:

- New features or functionality
- API changes (endpoints, parameters, responses)
- Breaking changes
- Configuration changes
- User-facing behavior changes
- Security updates affecting users

Changes that typically don't require documentation updates:

- Internal refactoring
- Test updates
- Build configuration changes
- Development tooling changes
- Dependency updates (unless they affect the public API)

## Set up autopilot

### Connect repositories to watch

1. Navigate to the [Autopilot](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) page in your dashboard
2. Click **Add repository**
3. Select the repository you want to watch
4. Configure the target branch (defaults to `main`)
5. Save your changes

Autopilot will now monitor this repository for merged pull requests.

### Install the GitHub App

The Mintlify GitHub App must be installed on both your code and documentation repositories:

1. Navigate to the [Agent](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/agent) page in your dashboard
2. Click **Add to new organization** to install the app on additional repositories
3. Select the repositories you want to grant access to
4. Save your changes

## Trigger analysis manually

You can manually trigger autopilot analysis for a specific pull request using the [Check PR endpoint](/api-reference/autopilot/check-pr):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mintlify.com/v1/autopilot/my-docs/suggestions/check \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mint_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "owner": "your-org",
    "repo": "your-repo",
    "pullRequestNumber": 123
  }'
```

This is useful for:

- Testing autopilot on historical PRs
- Re-analyzing PRs that were merged before autopilot was enabled
- Integrating autopilot checks into custom workflows

## Review and act on suggestions

When autopilot creates a suggestion:

1. Navigate to the [Autopilot](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) page in your dashboard
2. Review the list of open suggestions
3. Click on a suggestion to see the PR details and the recommended documentation updates
4. Use the agent to implement the suggested changes by providing the prompt to the agent
5. Mark the suggestion as resolved once the documentation is updated

## Webhook behavior

Autopilot integrates with GitHub webhooks to automatically detect merged pull requests. When a PR is merged:

1. GitHub sends a webhook to Mintlify
2. Mintlify checks if any deployments are watching the repository
3. For each watching deployment, autopilot queues an analysis job
4. The analysis runs asynchronously and creates suggestions if needed

This asynchronous approach ensures that webhook responses are fast and don't block your GitHub workflow.
