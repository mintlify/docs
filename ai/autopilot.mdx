<Info>
  Autopilot is available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=autopilot).
</Info>

Autopilot monitors your GitHub repositories and generates AI-powered suggestions to improve your documentation. When code changes occur in your connected repositories, Autopilot analyzes the changes and creates pull requests with proposed documentation updates.

Use Autopilot to:

- Identify documentation gaps when new features are added
- Keep API references in sync with code changes
- Receive proactive suggestions for documentation improvements

## Configure Autopilot

Manage Autopilot settings from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot). Click **Configuration** to access the settings page where you can connect and manage monitored repositories.

### Connect a repository

Connect GitHub repositories to enable Autopilot monitoring.

1. Navigate to the [Autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard.
2. Click **Configuration**.
3. In the **Repository Monitoring** section, select an organization from the dropdown.
4. Select a repository from the available repositories.
5. Specify the branch to monitor (defaults to `main`).
6. Click **Connect** to add the repository.

<Note>
  Autopilot can only access repositories from GitHub organizations that have the Mintlify GitHub App installed. Configure repository access in the [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
</Note>

### Remove a repository

Remove repositories that you no longer want Autopilot to monitor.

1. Navigate to the [Autopilot settings page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot/settings) in your dashboard.
2. Find the repository in the **Connected repositories** list.
3. Click the **X** button next to the repository to remove it.

## How Autopilot works

When you connect a repository, Autopilot:

1. **Monitors changes**: Watches for new commits and pull requests on the specified branch.
2. **Analyzes code**: Reviews changes to identify potential documentation impacts.
3. **Generates suggestions**: Creates AI-powered recommendations for documentation updates.
4. **Creates pull requests**: Opens PRs with proposed changes to your documentation repository.

Review Autopilot suggestions from the main Autopilot dashboard page, where you can see pending suggestions and take action on them.
