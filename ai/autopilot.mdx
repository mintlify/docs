</Note>

Autopilot monitors your selected Git repositories and suggests documentation updates. Autopilot flags potential user-facing changes in your application and prepares context for the agent to draft a pull request to update your documentation.

Use autopilot to proactively keep your documentation up to date when new features or updates ship.

## How autopilot works

When a pull request merges to a monitored repository, a webhook notifies autopilot. Autopilot analyzes the pull request title, description, and changed files to determine if the changes are user-facing and require documentation updates.

If the changes in a pull request require documentation updates, autopilot creates a suggestion in your dashboard. You can then apply the suggestion or dismiss it.

## Prerequisites

Before using autopilot, you must install the [Mintlify GitHub App](/deploy/github) and have at least one repository accessible to the app.

## Access autopilot

Navigate to the [autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard to view suggestions and configure repository monitoring. The autopilot page shows pending suggestions that need your review and provides access to configuration settings.

## Configure autopilot

Configure autopilot settings from the autopilot page by clicking the **Configuration** button.

</Frame>

The configuration page displays all GitHub organizations where you've installed the Mintlify GitHub App and which repositories autopilot is monitoring.

### Select repositories to monitor

After installing the Mintlify GitHub App on your organizations, you can select which repositories to monitor.

1. Navigate to the [autopilot settings page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot/settings).
1. Find the GitHub organization that the repository you want to monitor belongs to.
1. Click the gear icon next to the organization name.

      <img src="/images/autopilot/org-config-dark.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the toggle on next to each repository you want to monitor.
1. Use the search bar to filter repositories by name.
1. Click **Enable all** or **Disable all** to quickly configure all repositories.

Autopilot monitors the default branch (typically `main`) for each repository. When a pull request merges to this branch, autopilot analyzes the changes and creates suggestions.

### Stop monitoring a repository

1. Navigate to the [autopilot settings page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot/settings).
1. Find the GitHub organization that the repository you want to stop monitoring belongs to.
1. Click the gear icon next to the organization name.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/autopilot/org-config-light.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/autopilot/org-config-dark.png" alt="The gear icon next to the organization name in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
1. Click the toggle off next to the repository you want to stop monitoring.
1. Use the search bar to filter repositories by name.

Autopilot stops monitoring the repository immediately. Any existing suggestions for that repository remain in your dashboard until you dismiss them.

## Review suggestions

When autopilot detects user-facing changes in your monitored repositories, it creates suggestions that appear in your dashboard. Each suggestion displays the pull request title, repository name, summary for why the change may need documentation updates, and when the suggestion was created.

### Apply suggestions

When you apply a suggestion, autopilot opens the [agent](/ai/agent) panel with context about the pull request. The agent receives the pull request URL and a summary about the changed files.

1. Navigate to the [autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard.
1. Click **Apply suggestion**.
1. Use the agent interface to refine the suggested documentation updates or create a pull request.

### Dismiss suggestions

If a suggestion doesn't require documentation updates or you've already addressed the changes, dismiss it to remove it from your dashboard.

1. Navigate to the [autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard.
1. Click **Dismiss**.

The suggestion is immediately removed from your visible list. Dismissed suggestions cannot be retrieved.
