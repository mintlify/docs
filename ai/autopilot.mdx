description: AI-powered suggestions for documentation gaps based on your codebase
---

Autopilot monitors your GitHub repositories and automatically suggests documentation improvements when it detects gaps between your code and documentation.

## How it works

Autopilot analyzes your connected repositories to identify:
- New features or APIs that lack documentation
- Code changes that may require documentation updates
- Inconsistencies between your codebase and existing docs

When Autopilot detects a documentation gap, it creates a suggestion that you can review and apply.

## Configure monitored repositories

Manage which repositories Autopilot monitors from the dashboard settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Autopilot settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Autopilot** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a repository">
    Click **Add repository** and select from your connected GitHub repositories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the branch">
    Choose which branch Autopilot should monitor for changes. By default, this is your repository's default branch.
  </Step>
</Steps>
