Autopilot monitors your GitHub repositories and provides AI-powered suggestions to improve your documentation. When code changes occur in your connected repositories, Autopilot analyzes the changes and identifies documentation gaps that need attention.

Use Autopilot to:

- Automatically detect when code changes require documentation updates
- Receive suggestions for new content based on repository activity
- Keep your documentation in sync with your codebase

## Access Autopilot

Navigate to the [Autopilot page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/autopilot) in your dashboard to view suggestions and configure repository monitoring.

## Configure repository monitoring

Connect GitHub repositories to Autopilot so it can monitor for documentation gaps.

### Connected repositories

To remove a repository from monitoring, click the **X** button next to the repository entry.

## Review suggestions

Autopilot displays documentation suggestions as a list of pull requests on the main Autopilot page. Each suggestion includes:
