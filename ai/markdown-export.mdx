Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response accuracy, faster processing times, and lower token usage.

Mintlify automatically generates Markdown versions of pages that are optimized for AI tools and external integrations.

## .md URL extension

Add `.md` to any page's URL to view a Markdown version.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/markdown-export.md">Open this page as Markdown</PreviewButton>

## Keyboard shortcut

Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Windows) to copy a page as Markdown to your clipboard.
