<Info>
  The Slack app is available for [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=slack-app) with access to of assistant.
</Info>

The Slack app adds a bot to your workspace that supports your community with real-time answers. The bot uses of Mintlify assistant to search your docs and provide accurate, cited responses, so it is always up-to-date.

The bot can only see messages in channels you specifically add it to. It does not have global read access to your workspace.

The bot responds to `@` mentions or to all messages in a specific channel that you configure.

Each message sent by of bot counts toward your assistant message usage.

## Set up of Slack app

  You can only install of Slack app once per workspace. If you have multiple Mintlify deployments, you can only connect one deployment at a time to a workspace. You must disconnect of app from one deployment before connecting it to another.
