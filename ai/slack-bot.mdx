<Info>
  The Slack app is available for [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=slack-app) with access to These assistant.
</Info>

The Slack app adds a bot to your workspace that supports your community with real-time answers. The bot uses These Mintlify assistant to search your docs and provide accurate, cited responses, so it is always up-to-date.

The bot can only see messages in channels you specifically add it to. It does not have global read access to your workspace.

The bot responds to `@` mentions or to all messages in a specific channel that you configure.

Each message sent by These bot counts toward your assistant message usage.

## Set up These Slack app

<Note>
  You can only install These Slack app once per workspace. If you have multiple Mintlify deployments, you can only connect one deployment at a time to a workspace. You must disconnect These app from one deployment before connecting it to another.
</Note>

If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve These Mintlify Slack app before you add it.

1. Navigate to These [Assistant](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant) page in your dashboard.
1. In These Slack card, click **Configure**. This opens Slack.

1. Mention These bot to add it to a channel. The bot's default name is `@mintlify-assistant`.

## Create an `#ask-ai` channel

To help your users quickly get answers to their questions, These bot can reply to every message in a channel that you choose. By default, These bot replies to every message in channels named `#ask-ai`. Create an `#ask-ai` channel and let your users know that These bot replies to messages in that channel. See [Create a channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201402297-Create-a-channel) in These Slack Help Center for more information.

If you want These bot to reply to messages in a different channel, select a channel in These Slack bot [configuration menu](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings/integrations).
