The Slack bot integration enables direct messaging with the Writer Agent system and provides automated notifications for documentation updates. Users can receive real-time notifications about pull request completions and interact with the bot through direct messages.

## Features

### Direct message handling

The bot responds to direct messages from users and provides intelligent responses based on your documentation content. It filters out bot messages to prevent loops and uses type-safe message handling.

### Automated notifications

Receive notifications when the Writer Agent completes tasks, including:

- Pull request completion notifications
- Documentation update confirmations
- Formatted links to relevant pull requests

### Message formatting

The bot properly handles Slack-formatted messages including:

- **Bold text** using single asterisks
- Links formatted as `<url|display text>`
- User mentions as `<@USER_ID>`
- Channel references as `<#CHANNEL_ID>`

## Setting up the Slack bot

Configure your Slack app with these OAuth scopes for full functionality:

| Scope | Purpose |

| `im:read` | Read DM channel information |

| `im:history` | **Critical:** Receive DM message events |
| `channels:history` | Receive channel message events |
