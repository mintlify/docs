<Info>

**Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19.00.0 or higher) before proceeding.

</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run 'Mintlify' on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `mint.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will offer an alternative port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Use port 3001 instead? [Y/n]
```

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

## Code Formatting

We suggest using appropriate extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider using the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.
