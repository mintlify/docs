<Info>
  Workflows are available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent).

  You can have up to 10 active workflows.
</Info>

Workflows run the agent automatically on a schedule or when a push happens to a repository you specify. Each workflow defines a prompt for the agent and a trigger for when to run it.

When a workflow runs, the agent clones any specified repositories as context, follows the prompt, and either opens a pull request or pushes changes directly to your deployment branch.

## Create a workflow file

Create `.md` files in a `.mintlify/workflows/` directory at the root of your documentation repository. Each file defines one workflow.

Workflow files use YAML frontmatter to configure the workflow, followed by a Markdown prompt for the agent.

```markdown .mintlify/workflows/update-changelog.md
---
name: Update changelog
on:
  cron: "0 9 * * 1"
context:
  - repo: your-org/your-product
automerge: false
---

Review all changes since the last changelog update. Draft a new
changelog post with any new features, bug fixes, or breaking changes.

Include information about what a change is and how it affects users.

Do not include any internal-only information or minor changes
like bumping package versions or updating documentation.
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Display name shown in the dashboard. |
| `on` | Yes | Trigger configuration. |
| `context` | No | Repositories cloned as reference when the workflow runs. |
| `automerge` | No | Defaults to `false`, which opens a pull request. If `true`, pushes changes directly to your deployment branch. |

You must have the Mintlify GitHub App installed on every repository listed in the `context` or `on.push.repo` fields. Add new repositories on the [GitHub app](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) page of your Mintlify dashboard.

## Triggers

Each workflow must define exactly one trigger using the `on` field.

### On schedule (cron)

Run a workflow on a recurring schedule using a cron expression. All schedules run in UTC.

Workflows queue within 10 minutes of the scheduled time and may take up to 10 minutes to run.

```yaml
on:
  cron: "0 9 * * 1"
```

The value is a standard 5-field cron expression in `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week` format. Use a tool like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to build and validate schedules.

| Expression | Schedule |
|------------|----------|
| `"0 9 * * 1"` | Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC |
| `"0 0 1 * *"` | First day of each month at midnight UTC |
| `"0 8 * * 1-5"` | Weekdays at 8:00 AM UTC |

### On merge

Run a workflow when a pull request merges to a specific repository and branch.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    - repo: your-org/your-product
      branch: main
```

- `repo`: The GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format.
- `branch` (optional): The branch to watch for merges. If you don't specify a branch, the workflow triggers on merges to the repository's default branch.

A workflow can watch for merges in multiple repositories or branches.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    - repo: your-org/your-product
    - repo: your-org/another-repo
      branch: release
```

## Reference repositories

Use `context` to give the agent read access to additional repositories when the workflow runs. This is useful when your prompt requires reviewing code or content outside your documentation repository.

```yaml
context:
  - repo: your-org/your-product
  - repo: your-org/design-system
```

## Auto-merge changes

By default, the agent opens a pull request for each workflow run so you can review changes before they go live. Set `automerge: true` to push changes directly to your deploy branch without a pull request.

```yaml
automerge: true
```
