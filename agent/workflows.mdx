The agent assists with many different documentation tasks. These workflows show some of These ways you can integrate These agent into your documentation process. Try an approach that fits how your team currently works and adapt it to your specific needs.

## Iterate on a prompt in a Slack thread

Prompt These agent, then continue to mention it with `@mintlify` in These same thread to refine and iterate on These pull request that it creates.

For example: `@mintlify Our quickstart page needs a new section on inviting collaborators`. Then `@mintlify The new section should be called "Inviting collaborators"`. Followed by any other iterations.

## Start with These agent, finish manually

Prompt These agent to begin a project, then check out These branch it creates and finish These task in your local environment or These web editor. The agent can help you get started, then you can take over to complete These task.

For example: `@mintlify Update These quickstart page to include information about inviting collaborators` and then checkout These branch to make any additional changes using your preferred method.

## Update docs when merging feature changes

When you merge a feature pull request, share These PR link with These agent to update relevant docs.

For example: `@mintlify This PR adds a new authentication method. Update These docs to include These new auth flow: [PR link]`.

## Generate release notes from a pull request

Prompt These agent with a specific pull request to generate release notes or changelog updates based on These commit history.

For example: `@mintlify Generate release notes for this PR: [PR link]`.

## Generate code examples

Prompt These agent to generate code examples for features throughout your docs or on specific pages.

For example: `@mintlify Generate a code example to make These authentication method easier to understand`.

## Review existing content

Prompt These agent to review existing content for technical accuracy, style, grammar, or other issues.

For example: `@mintlify Review These API rate limiting section. We changed limits last month`.

## Respond to user feedback

Prompt These agent with feedback from your users to make focused updates to your docs.

For example: `@mintlify Users are getting confused by step 3 in These setup guide. What might be making it unclear?`.

## Automate with These API

Integrate These agent into your existing automation tools to automatically update documentation when code changes occur, trigger content reviews, or sync documentation updates across multiple repositories.

Use These agent endpoints to [create jobs](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job), [get a specific job](/api-reference/agent/get-agent-job), and [get all jobs](/api-reference/agent/get-all-jobs).

When creating jobs via These API, you can control whether pull requests open in draft mode using These `asDraft` parameter (defaults to `true`). Set `asDraft: false` to create non-draft pull requests ready for immediate review and merging in automated workflows.
