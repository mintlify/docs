<Info>
  The agent is available on [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) for anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

The agent creates pull requests with proposed changes to your documentation based on your prompts. When you send a request to the agent, it references your documentation, connected repositories, and Slack messages to create content that follows technical writing best practices and adheres to the Mintlify schema.

## What you can do with the agent

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, links to pull requests, or Slack threads.
- Revise outdated code examples and API references.
- Search and update existing content.
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics.
- Capture knowledge from Slack conversations and pull requests before it gets lost.

## Where you can use the agent

- **Dashboard**: From any page in your dashboard, use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to open the agent panel. Or click **Ask agent** on the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page.
