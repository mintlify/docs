<Info>
  The agent is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) for anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

The agent is an AI tool that creates pull requests with proposed changes to your documentation based on your prompts. When you send a request, the agent:

- **Researches**: Reads your existing documentation, any connected repositories, and relevant context.
- **Plans**: Creates a structured task list for complex documentation work.
- **Writes**: Generates or updates content following writing standards and best practices.
- **Validates**: Runs Mintlify CLI checks to ensure documentation builds correctly.
- **Creates a PR**: Opens a pull request with proposed changes for review.

All changes go through pull requests. The agent never commits directly to your main branch.

## What you can do with the agent

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, pull requests, Slack threads, or file attachments.
- Update existing documentation for new features or API changes.
- Process and include images, diagrams, and other files from Slack attachments.
- Search and revise code examples and API references across your docs.
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics.
- Address code review feedback to maintain documentation quality.
- Capture knowledge from Slack conversations and pull requests before it gets lost.
- Navigate and coordinate changes across multiple files and directories efficiently.

## Where you can use the agent

- **Dashboard**: From any page in your dashboard, use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to open the agent panel. Or click **Ask agent** on the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page.

- **API**: Embed the agent in custom applications using the [agent endpoints](/api/agent/create-agent-job).
