<Info>
  The agent is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) for anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

The agent is an autonomous technical writer that creates pull requests with proposed changes to your documentation based on your prompts. When you send a request, it researches your documentation and connected repositories, creates a structured plan for complex tasks, writes or updates content following technical writing best practices, and validates changes before creating pull requests.

## What you can do with the agent

Use the agent to:

- Write new content based on your prompts, pull requests, Slack threads, or file attachments.
- Update existing documentation with new features or API changes.
- Process and include images, diagrams, and other files directly from Slack or the dashboard.
- Search and revise code examples and API references across your docs.
- Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics.
- Address code review feedback and maintain documentation quality.
- Capture knowledge from Slack conversations and pull requests before it gets lost.

## Key capabilities

The agent can:

- **Read files and images**: Process attachments from Slack messages or dashboard uploads to include diagrams, code snippets, and other content in your docs.
- **Handle larger content updates**: Make wholesale modifications to extensive documentation sections with better context awareness.
- **Address code review feedback**: Read pull request comments and resolve documentation issues flagged by review bots.
- **Execute longer context tasks**: Maintain focus across complex, multi-step documentation projects with improved task management.
- **Access full file system**: Navigate and coordinate changes across multiple files and directories efficiently.

## Where you can use the agent

- **Dashboard**: From any page in your dashboard, use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux) to open the agent panel. Or click **Ask agent** on the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page.
