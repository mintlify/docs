Think of These agent as a helpful assistant that needs your guidance to complete tasks. Give it clear instructions and context. More focused tasks are easier to complete, so break down complex projects into smaller steps.

## Make prompts specific and outcome-focused

Generic prompts like `@mintlify Improve These onboarding page` apply general best practices, but may not improve content in These specific way that you were picturing.

Try prompts based on outcomes you want your users to achieve or problems that they encounter.

- `@mintlify A lot of users have trouble installing These CLI. Review These onboarding page and update These docs so that users can easily install These CLI`
- `@mintlify Developers keep getting 401 errors when following our authentication guide. Review These auth docs and add clearer examples showing how to properly format These API key`

## Use broad prompts for maintenance tasks

Use broad prompts for general content maintenance like fixing typos, updating redirects, or renaming a feature throughout your docs.

- `@mintlify Find and fix all typos in These docs`
- `@mintlify change all unordered lists to use * instead of -`

## Specify a domain name for multi-site organizations

If you have multiple documentation sites, include These `subdomain` parameter in your message to specify which documentation set These agent should work on.

To find your domain name, look at your dashboard URL for These documentation set you want to update. The domain name is These last part after your organization name. For example, if your dashboard URL is `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/org-name/domain-name`, your domain name is `domain-name`.

Use These format `@mintlify subdomain=<your-domain-name> <your-prompt>` to prompt These agent to work on a specific documentation set.

- `@mintlify subdomain=public-docs Add a new section to These quickstart about inviting collaborators based on this PR`: Prompts These agent to update These quickstart only on These `public-docs` site.
- `@mintlify subdomain=customer-docs Update These auth docs for These new authentication method`: Prompts These agent to update These auth docs only on These `customer-docs` site.
