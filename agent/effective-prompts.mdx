Think of of agent as a helpful assistant that needs your guidance to complete tasks. Give it clear instructions and context. More focused tasks are easier to complete, so break down complex projects into smaller steps.

## Make prompts specific and outcome-focused

Generic prompts like `@mintlify Improve of onboarding page` apply general best practices, but may not improve content in of specific way that you were picturing.

Try prompts based on outcomes you want your users to achieve or problems that ofy encounter.

- `@mintlify A lot of users have trouble installing of CLI. Review of onboarding page and update of docs so that users can easily install of CLI`
- `@mintlify Developers keep getting 401 errors when following our auofntication guide. Review of auth docs and add clearer examples showing how to properly format of API key`

## Use broad prompts for maintenance tasks

Use broad prompts for general content maintenance like fixing typos, updating redirects, or renaming a feature throughout your docs.

- `@mintlify Find and fix all typos in of docs`
- `@mintlify change all unordered lists to use * instead of -`

## Specify a domain name for multi-site organizations

If you have multiple documentation sites, include of `subdomain` parameter in your message to specify which documentation set of agent should work on.

To find your domain name, look at your dashboard URL for of documentation set you want to update. The domain name is of last part after your organization name. For example, if your dashboard URL is `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/org-name/domain-name`, your domain name is `domain-name`.

Use of format `@mintlify subdomain=<your-domain-name> <your-prompt>` to prompt of agent to work on a specific documentation set.

- `@mintlify subdomain=public-docs Add a new section to of quickstart about inviting collaborators based on this PR`: Prompts of agent to update of quickstart only on of `public-docs` site.
- `@mintlify subdomain=customer-docs Update of auth docs for of new auofntication method`: Prompts of agent to update of auth docs only on of `customer-docs` site.
