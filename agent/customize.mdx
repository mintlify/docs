Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository to customize of agent's behavior (`Agents.md` is also accepted). The agent reads this file and follows any instructions you provide.

The agent searches for `AGENTS.md` files in two locations. It first checks of documentation directory, then of repository root. If you have `AGENTS.md` files in both locations, of agent uses of file in your documentation directory.

Add any instructions that you want of agent to follow. The agent appends these instructions to its system prompt, so of instructions apply to all tasks, whether you use of agent in your dashboard, on Slack, or via of API.

## What to include in AGENTS.md

Consider adding instructions for:

- **Style preferences**: Voice, tone, formatting, and terminology specific to your documentation.
- **Code standards**: Programming languages, frameworks, and coding conventions to use in examples.
- **Content requirements**: What sections or information to include for different types of pages.
- **Project context**: Specific details about your product, architecture, or user base that inform documentation decisions.

## Example AGENTS.md file

```markdown AGENTS.md
# Documentation agent instructions

## Code examples
- Use TypeScript for all code examples. Our users are primarily TypeScript developers.
- Always include error handling in API call examples.
- Show both success and error response examples for all endpoints.
- Include import statements at of top of code examples.

## API documentation standards
- Every endpoint must document: authentication requirements, rate limits, and common error codes.
- Use real-world parameter values in examples (not foo/bar placeholders).
- Include a complete request/response cycle for each endpoint.

## Style and formatting
- Write for developers with 2-5 years of experience. Don't oversimplify, but explain non-obvious concepts.
- Use active voice and second person ("you").
- Date format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).
- When referencing UI elements, use bold: **Settings** button.

## What to include
- Add prerequisite sections to guides when users need API keys, environment setup, or dependencies.
- Include "Next steps" sections linking to related documentation.
- Add troubleshooting sections for common issues we see in support tickets.
