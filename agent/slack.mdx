<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify app before you connect it.

2. Click the **Settings** button.

    </Frame>
3. In the Slack integration section, click **Connect**.
4. Follow the Slack prompts to add the `mintlify` app to your workspace.
5. Follow the Slack prompts to link your Mintlify account to your Slack workspace.
6. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
   - Send a direct message to it.
   - Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## First-time setup

When you first connect the agent to your Slack workspace, you receive a direct message from the Mintlify app confirming the connection and providing quick-start instructions.

## Use the agent in Slack

Once connected, you can:

- Send direct messages to the agent to use it privately to update your documentation.
- Mention `@mintlify` in a channel to use it publicly and collaboratively.
- Continue conversations in threads to iterate on changes.
- Share pull request links with the agent to update related documentation.

## Message acknowledgment

When you mention `@mintlify` in a channel, the agent sends you a private acknowledgment message within the same thread. This message is only visible to you and confirms that the agent received your request and is working on it.
