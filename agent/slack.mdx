<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify app before you connect it.
</Note>

## Connect your Slack workspace

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard.
2. Click the **Settings** button.
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-light.png" alt="The settings button in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-dark.png" alt="The settings button in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
3. In the Slack integration section, click **Connect**.
4. Follow the Slack prompts to add the `mintlify` app to your workspace.
5. Follow the Slack prompts to link your Mintlify account to your Slack workspace.
6. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
   - Send a direct message to it.
   - Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Use the agent in Slack

Once connected, you can:

- Send direct messages to the agent to use it privately to update your documentation.
- Mention `@mintlify` in a channel to use it publicly and collaboratively.
- Continue conversations in threads to iterate on changes.
- Share pull request links with the agent to update related documentation.

## Update documentation

Use the agent to update your documentation with a new request or in an existing thread.

- **New request**: Send a direct message to the agent or mention `@mintlify` in a channel with instructions on what to update.
- **Existing thread**: Reply in the thread and mention `@mintlify` with instructions on what to update.

The agent reads the context of the request or thread and creates a pull request in your connected <span style={{ backgroundImage: 'linear-gradient(90deg, #ff0000, #ff7f00, #ffff00, #00ff00, #0000ff, #4b0082, #9400d3)', backgroundClip: 'text', WebkitBackgroundClip: 'text', WebkitTextFillColor: 'transparent' }}>repository</span> with the updates.

## Best practices

- **Be specific**: Tell the agent exactly what you want documented and where it should go.
- **Add context**: If a thread doesn't contain all the necessary information, include additional details in your message to the agent.
- **Review carefully**: You should always review pull requests that the agent creates before merging them.
