<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify app before you connect it.
</Note>

## Connect your Slack workspace

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard.
2. Click the **Settings** button.
    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-light.png" alt="The settings button in light mode." className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/agent/dashboard-settings-dark.png" alt="The settings button in dark mode." className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
3. In the Slack integration section, click **Connect**.
4. Follow the Slack prompts to add the `mintlify` app to your workspace.
5. Follow the Slack prompts to link your Mintlify account to your Slack workspace.
6. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
   - Send a direct message to it.
   - Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Use the agent in Slack

Once connected, you can:

- Send direct messages to the agent to use it privately to update your documentation.
- Mention `@mintlify` in a channel to use it publicly and collaboratively.
- Attach files and images directly to your messages for the agent to process and include in your docs.
- Continue conversations in threads to iterate on changes.
- Share pull request links with the agent to update related documentation.

## Update documentation

Use the agent to update your documentation with a new request or in an existing thread.

- **New request**: Send a direct message to the agent or mention `@mintlify` in a channel with instructions on what to update.
- **Existing thread**: Reply in the thread and mention `@mintlify` with instructions on what to update.
- **With attachments**: Upload images, diagrams, code files, or other documents with your message. The agent automatically processes and includes them in your documentation.

The agent reads the context of the request or thread and creates a pull request in your connected repository with the updates.

### Using file attachments

Attach files to your Slack message when requesting documentation updates:

```
@mintlify Add this architecture diagram to the system overview page
[attach: diagram.png]
```

```
@mintlify Document these API endpoints
[attach: api-spec.yaml]
```

The agent automatically fetches, processes, and integrates the files into your documentation.

## Best practices

- **Be specific**: Tell the agent exactly what you want documented and where it should go.
- **Add context**: If a thread doesn't contain all the necessary information, include additional details in your message to the agent.
- **Review carefully**: You should always review pull requests that the agent creates before merging them.
