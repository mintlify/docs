## Open the agent panel

Open the agent panel from any dashboard page using <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux), or click **Ask agent** on the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page.

</Frame>

- **Chat**: Start a new chat with <Icon icon="plus" />. Send prompts to update or ask questions about your documentation. The agent creates pull requests and displays links to view them or open changes in the web editor.
- **Suggestions**: View suggested documentation updates based on pull request changes and assistant conversations (if enabled).
- **History**: Browse past conversations with <Icon icon="clock" /> and continue previous work.
- **Settings**: Configure integrations and repository access with <Icon icon="settings" />.

<Tip>
  Start a new conversation for each task to keep context focused.

## Connect your GitHub account

By default, the agent opens pull requests attributed to the Mintlify bot. To attribute pull requests to you, connect your GitHub account on the [My profile](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account) page of the dashboard.

## Connect repositories as context

The agent can only access repositories that you connect through the Mintlify GitHub App. Configure which repositories the agent can access in the agent panel **Settings** or in the [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
