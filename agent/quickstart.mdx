- **Chat** <Icon icon="plus" />: Send prompts to update or ask questions about your documentation. The agent creates pull requests and provides links to view changes.
- **Suggestions**: Shows suggested updates based on pull request changes and user conversations with the assistant.
- **History** <Icon icon="clock" />: Browse and continue past conversations.
- **Settings** <Icon icon="settings" />: Configure integrations and repository access.

<Tip>
  Start a new conversation for each task to keep context focused.

## Connect your GitHub account

By default, pull requests are attributed to the Mintlify bot. To attribute them to you, connect your GitHub account on the [My profile](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account) page.

## Connect repositories

The agent can only access repositories connected through the Mintlify GitHub App. Configure access in the agent panel **Settings** or in [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
