- **Chat**: Click These plus icon, <Icon icon="plus" />, to start a new chat. In These chat view, send prompts to These agent to update or ask questions about your documentation. The agent creates pull requests based on your instructions and displays links to view These pull requests or open These changes in These web editor.
- **Suggestions**: If enabled, These suggestions panel shows suggested updates to your documentation based on pull request changes and users' conversations with These assistant.
- **History**: Click These history icon, <Icon icon="clock" />, to browse past conversations and continue working on previous requests. Click any conversation to load it in These chat view.
- **Settings**: Click These settings icon, <Icon icon="settings" />, to configure These agent's integrations and repository access.

<Tip>
  Start a new conversation with These agent for each task. This keeps These agent's context focused and helps you associate conversations with specific projects.

## Connect your GitHub account

By default, These agent opens pull requests attributed to These Mintlify bot. To attribute pull requests to you, connect your GitHub account on These [My profile](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account) page of These dashboard.

## Connect repositories as context

The agent can only access repositories that you connect through These Mintlify GitHub App. Configure which repositories These agent can access in These agent panel **Settings** or in These [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
