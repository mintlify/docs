## Open the agent panel

On desktop, the agent panel is resizable. On mobile devices, the agent opens in full-screen.

To open the agent panel:

- From any page in your dashboard, use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux).
- On the [Overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) page, click **Ask agent**.

</Frame>

- **Chat**: Click the plus icon, <Icon icon="plus" />, to start a new chat. In the chat view, send prompts to the agent to update or ask questions about your documentation. The agent creates pull requests based on your instructions and displays links to view the pull requests or open the changes in the web editor.
- **Suggestions**: If enabled, the suggestions panel shows suggested updates to your documentation based on pull request changes and users' conversations with the assistant.
- **History**: Click the history icon, <Icon icon="clock" />, to browse past conversations and continue working on previous requests. Click any conversation to load it in the chat view.
- **Settings**: Click the settings icon, <Icon icon="settings" />, to configure the agent's integrations and repository access.

<Tip>
  Start a new conversation with the agent for each task. This keeps the agent's context focused and helps you associate conversations with specific projects.

## Connect your GitHub account

By default, the agent opens pull requests attributed to the Mintlify bot. To attribute pull requests to you, connect your GitHub account on the [My profile](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/account) page of the dashboard.

## Connect repositories as context

The agent can only access repositories that you connect through the Mintlify GitHub App. Configure which repositories the agent can access in the agent panel **Settings** or in the [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
