<Info>
  Agent v2 is available on [Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) and is powered by Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet model.
</Info>

Agent v2 is an autonomous technical writer powered by Claude 4.5 Sonnet. It creates pull requests with documentation changes based on your prompts, references your codebase and Slack conversations, and follows technical writing best practices.

## Core capabilities

The agent can:

- **Write new documentation**: Create pages from scratch based on prompts, pull requests, or Slack threads
- **Update existing content**: Search and revise documentation to keep it current
- **Review code changes**: Reference connected repositories to document new features or API changes
- **Answer questions**: Provide information about your docs and technical writing best practices
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow your documentation style and Mintlify schema automatically

## How the agent works

When you send a request, the agent:

1. **Researches**: Reads your existing documentation, connected repositories, and relevant context
2. **Plans**: Creates a structured task list for complex documentation work
3. **Writes**: Generates or updates content following technical writing standards
4. **Validates**: Runs Mintlify CLI checks to ensure documentation builds correctly
5. **Creates PR**: Opens a pull request with proposed changes for human review

All changes go through pull requests. The agent never commits directly to your main branch.

## Tools and capabilities

The agent has access to specialized tools for documentation work:

### File operations
- **Read**: Access any file in your repository with line number references
- **Edit**: Make precise changes to existing documentation
- **Write**: Create new documentation pages
- **Search**: Find files by pattern (glob) or content (grep)

### Git and GitHub
- **Branch management**: Create and switch branches
- **Commit changes**: Stage and commit updates with descriptive messages
- **Pull requests**: Open PRs with clear descriptions using `gh` CLI
- **Issue tracking**: Reference and update GitHub issues

### Mintlify CLI validation
- **mint validate**: Check documentation structure and configuration
- **mint broken-links**: Verify internal links are correct
- **mint dev**: Preview changes locally (requires manual setup)

### Specialized agents
The agent can launch sub-agents for specific tasks:
- **Explore agent**: Navigate large codebases and find relevant files
- **General agent**: Handle complex multi-step documentation tasks

### Task management
- **TodoWrite**: Track multi-step documentation work and show progress
- Prevents goal drift during complex updates
- Provides visibility into what's being worked on

## Configuration with AGENTS.md

Customize the agent's behavior by adding a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file to your repository root. This file defines:

- **Working relationship**: How the agent communicates and asks for clarification
- **Content strategy**: Documentation philosophy and principles
- **Writing standards**: Voice, tone, formatting conventions
- **Workflow requirements**: Git practices, validation steps, PR guidelines

The agent automatically reads and follows instructions in this file. See the [customize](/agent/customize) page for details.

## Where to use agent v2

- **Dashboard**: Press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (macOS) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> (Windows/Linux) from any dashboard page
- **Slack**: Mention `@mintlify` in any channel where the agent is installed
- **API**: Integrate with custom applications using [agent endpoints](/api/agent/create-agent-job)

## Key differences from v1

Agent v2 introduces:

- **Autonomous planning**: Creates task lists and manages complex multi-step documentation work
- **Better validation**: Runs Mintlify CLI checks before creating pull requests
- **Enhanced research**: Can explore connected repositories and reference source code
- **Tool specialization**: Access to dedicated file operations instead of relying only on bash commands
- **Configurable behavior**: Respects AGENTS.md configuration files in your repository
- **Task visibility**: Shows progress through todo lists as it works

## Best practices

### Writing effective prompts

Be specific about what you want:

```
❌ "Update the docs"
✅ "Add a section to /api-playground/overview explaining how to add authentication headers to API requests"
```

Provide context when needed:

```
✅ "Document the new rate limiting feature. See PR #123 for implementation details."
```

Reference specific files or sections:

```
✅ "Update /agent/quickstart to include the new keyboard shortcuts"
```

### Working with the agent

- **Review PRs carefully**: The agent flags uncertainties with TODO comments
- **Provide feedback**: Iterate on drafts by requesting specific changes
- **Link to sources**: Reference pull requests, issues, or Slack threads for context
- **Check validation**: The agent runs checks, but preview changes with `mint dev` locally

### Configuration tips

Add a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file to:
- Define your documentation voice and tone
- Specify formatting preferences
- Set git workflow requirements
- Establish validation criteria

See [customize documentation](/agent/customize) for examples.

## Limitations

The agent:

- Cannot preview visual changes (requires manual `mint dev` check)
- May need clarification for complex or ambiguous requests
- Adds TODO comments when uncertain about technical details
- Requires human review before changes merge

## Technical details

- **Model**: Claude 4.5 Sonnet by Anthropic
- **Context window**: Up to 200K tokens
- **Validation**: Runs `mint validate` before creating PRs
- **Git workflow**: Creates feature branches and never commits to main directly
- **Security**: Respects repository permissions and cannot access secrets
