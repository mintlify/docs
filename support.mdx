<Accordion title="API Page Issues" icon="book-open">
  API pages are complicated. As a result, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. Here's a list of common issues we've seen customers run into:

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
      In this scenario, it's likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
      or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

      Running `mintlify dev` locally should reveal some of these issues.

      To verify your OpenAPI document will pass validation:

      1. Run `mintlify openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>` in your CLI
      2. Check the spec for errors with [this validator](https://editor.swagger.io/)

      Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
      you could encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/)

      <Frame>

      </Frame>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
      This is usually caused by a misspelled `openapi` field in the page metadata. Make sure that the HTTP method and path match the HTTP method and path in the OpenAPI document exactly.

      Here's an example of how things might go wrong:

      ```md get-user.mdx
      ---
      openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
      ---
      ```

      ```yaml openapi.yaml
      paths:
        "/users/{id}":
          get: ...
      ```
      Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, whereas the path in the OpenAPI
      document does not.

      Another common issue is a misspelled filename. If you are specifying a particular OpenAPI document
      in the `openapi` field, ensure the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
      documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata might look like this:

      ```md api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx
      ---
      openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
      ---
      ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
      If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
      default, requests made via the API Playground start with a `POST` request to the
      `/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
      requests, then all of these requests will fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to
      allow `POST` requests to the `/api/request` path.

      Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the `api.playground.proxy` setting in the `docs.json`, as described [here](/core-concepts/settings#param-proxy). This will
      likely require you to configure CORS on your server, as these requests will now come directly
      from your users' browsers.

<Accordion title="Docs page won't load (error 404)" icon="ban" iconType="regular">
  Check to see if you have `/api` in the URL. This is a reserved folder in production environments, which produces a 404 error.

<Accordion title="Issues adding SVG to a card" icon="image">
We support a specific type of SVG, called JSX, and as such the image will need to be converted.

1. Use the [SVGR converter](https://react-svgr.com/playground/) to generate JSX compatible SVG code.
2. Copy the code inside the `<svg/>` tag.

![Output from the SVGR converter with the code inside <svg> and </svg> tags highlighted.](/images/svg-jsx.png)

3. Paste the code into your card. Make sure you only copy and paste the code inside the `<svg/>` tag.
4. You may need to decrease the height and width to make the image fit.
