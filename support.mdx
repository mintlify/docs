## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Docs page won't load (error 404)" icon="ban" iconType="regular">
    Check to see if you have `/api` in the URL. This is a reserved folder in production environments, which produces a 404 error.
  </Accordion>


  <Accordion title="Issues adding SVG to a card" icon="image">
  We support a specific type of SVG, called JSX, and as such the image will need to be converted.

  1. Use the [SVGR converter](https://react-svgr.com/playground/) to generate JSX compatible SVG code.
  2. Copy the code inside the `<svg/>` tag.

  ![Output from the SVGR converter with the code inside <svg> and </svg> tags highlighted.](/images/svg-jsx.png)

  3. Paste the code into your card. Make sure you only copy and paste the code inside the `<svg/>` tag.
  4. You may need to decrease the height and width to make the image fit.
