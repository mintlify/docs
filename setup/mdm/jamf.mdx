# Overview

This guide will walk you through deploying Repacket to your macOS devices using Jamf Pro.

Jamf deployment has two main components:

1. **MDM Profile**: a configuration profile that contains the certificate, system extension, VPN / Network Extension, and privacy permissions so users never see a pop-up.
2. **Managed Installation**: a Jamf policy that silently installs the Repacket macOS app on your endpoints.

## Deploying

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download MobileConfig & Installer">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
      <Card
        title="Repacket – MobileConfig (.mobileconfig)"
        icon="file"
        href="https://repacket-installers.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Repacket.mobileconfig"
      />
      <Card
        title="Repacket – macOS Installer (.pkg)"
        icon="apple"
        href="https://repacket-installers.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Repacket.pkg"
      />
    </CardGroup>

    Download both the configuration profile and installer package to your computer. You’ll upload these into Jamf Pro in the next steps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload the MobileConfig file">
    In your Jamf Pro dashboard, navigate to  
    <Highlight text="Computers" /> → <Highlight text="Configuration Profiles" /> → <Highlight text="New" />.

    On the <Highlight text="General" /> tab:

    - Set a name like <Highlight text="Repacket – macOS" />.
    - Select <Highlight text="Upload" /> and choose the downloaded `.mobileconfig` file.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy profile to devices">
    With the profile created, go to the <Highlight text="Scope" /> tab.

    - Under <Highlight text="Target Computers" />, add the smart groups or specific computers that should receive Repacket.
    - (Optional) Start with a test group first, then expand to your full fleet.

    Save the profile.

    On a scoped device, you should see the Repacket profile listed in macOS under  
    <Highlight text="System Settings" /> → <Highlight text="Privacy & Security" /> → <Highlight text="Profiles" />.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the application pkg">
    Create a [Jamf Package Deployment](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Package_Deployment.html) and upload the installation pkg.

    Next, scope the target machines you want to install to and send. The scoped devices will install the package, and require no manual intervention.

  </Step>

  <Step title="You're finished!">
    Once devices receive both:

    1. The **Repacket configuration profile**, and  
    2. The **Repacket installer policy**,

    Repacket will be silently installed and fully permitted on your Jamf-managed Macs. New machines added to your scoped groups will automatically receive Repacket without any user pop-ups.
