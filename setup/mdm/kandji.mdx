# Overview

This guide will walk you through deploying Repacket to your macOS devices using Kandji.

Kandji deployment has two main components:

1. **MDM Profile** – a configuration profile that contains the certificate, system extension, VPN / Network Extension, and privacy permissions so users never see a pop-up.
2. **Custom App Deployment** – a Kandji Custom App that installs the Repacket macOS app on your endpoints.

We recommend deploying the profile **before** the application so that all permissions are in place when Repacket launches.

## Deploying

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download our Kandji assets">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
      <Card
        title="Repacket – MobileConfig (.mobileconfig)"
        icon="file"
        href="https://repacket-installers.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Repacket.mobileconfig"
      />
      <Card
        title="Repacket – macOS Installer (.pkg)"
        icon="apple"
        href="https://repacket-installers.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Repacket.pkg"
      />
    </CardGroup>

    Download both the configuration profile and installer package.  
    You’ll upload these into Kandji in the following steps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Repacket custom profile">
    In your Kandji dashboard, navigate to <Highlight text="Library" /> and click  
    <Highlight text="+ Add Library Item" />.

    Under the <Highlight text="General" /> section, select <Highlight text="Custom Profile" /> and click <Highlight text="Add and configure" />.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload the Repacket mobileconfig">
    On the new Custom Profile:

    - Set a name such as <Highlight text="Repacket Deployment" />.
    - Ensure <Highlight text="Install on" /> includes <Highlight text="Mac" />.
    - Scroll to <Highlight text="Profile Details" /> and upload the `Repacket.mobileconfig` file you downloaded earlier.

    Kandji will show an XML preview of the profile contents once it’s uploaded.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign the profile to Blueprints">
    Still on the Repacket Deployment profile:

    - In the <Highlight text="Assignment" /> section, choose the <Highlight text="Blueprints" /> you want Repacket deployed on.
    - You can use Assignment Maps or Classic Blueprints, depending on how your Kandji environment is configured.

    We recommend deploying this profile to your target Blueprints **before** you deploy the Repacket app to avoid any user pop-ups.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Custom App">
    Next, add Repacket as a Custom App.

    1. Go back to <Highlight text="Library" /> and click <Highlight text="+ Add Library Item" />.
    2. Under <Highlight text="General" />, select <Highlight text="Custom Apps" /> and click <Highlight text="Add and configure" />.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload the Repacket installer pkg">
    In the Custom App configuration:

    - Under <Highlight text="Install Details" />, choose <Highlight text="Installer Package (install .pkg or .mpkg)" />.
    - Upload the `Repacket.pkg`
    - Leave pre/post-install scripts empty unless your environment requires them.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose installation behavior & scope">
    In the <Highlight text="Settings" /> section:

    - Set <Highlight text="Installation" /> to <Highlight text="Install once per device" /> for a one-time install, or  
      <Highlight text="Audit and enforce" /> if you want Kandji to ensure Repacket stays installed.
    - (Optional) Toggle Self Service if you would like users to install on-demand.
    - Assign the Custom App to the same Blueprints you used for the Repacket Deployment profile.

  </Step>

  <Step title="You're finished!">
    After the profile and Custom App are assigned:

    - Devices in the scoped Blueprints will first receive the **Repacket profile** (certificate, system extension, VPN, and privacy permissions).
    - Kandji will then install the **Repacket App** via the Custom App item.

    You can verify everything from the <Highlight text="Library" /> page, where you should see both the Repacket Deployment profile and the Repacket App listed.
