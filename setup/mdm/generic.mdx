# Generic MDM Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying Repacket via any MDM platform that supports application deployment and configuration profiles. The process involves deploying the appropriate installer and configuring necessary system permissions.

## Prerequisites

- Administrative access to your MDM platform
- Ability to deploy applications (.exe for Windows, .pkg for MacOS)
- Ability to deploy configuration profiles (especially for MacOS)
- Optional: Ability to deploy files for registration keys (for silent enrollment)

## Available Downloads

Before starting, ensure you have access to the latest Repacket installers:

## Windows Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the Repacket installer">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
        <Card title="Repacket Agent (Windows)" icon="windows" href="https://repacket-installers.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Repacket.exe" />
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload to your MDM platform">
    Upload the installer to your MDM's application catalog with the following details:

    Application Name: ```Repacket```

    Publisher: ```Repacket```

    Description: ```Repacket keeps employees safe while browsing online```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure installation parameters">
    Set up the installation commands and behavior:

    Install Command: ```Repacket.exe /VERYSILENT```

    Uninstall Command: ```C:\Program Files\Repacket\unins000.exe /VERYSILENT```

    Installation Context: ```System```

    Estimated Installation Time: ```3 minutes```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up detection rules">
    Configure how your MDM will detect successful installation:

    Detection Method: ```File/Folder exists```

    Path: ```C:\Program Files\Repacket```

    Type: ```Folder```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to target devices">
    Deploy the application to your desired groups:
    - Assign the application to your desired user groups or device groups
    - Set deployment type to "Required" for automatic installation
    - Configure deployment schedule as needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify deployment">
    After deployment, verify that:
    - The Repacket service is running on target devices
    - Users can access the Repacket interface when browsing
    - Network traffic is being properly routed through Repacket
  </Step>
</Steps>

## MacOS Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the Repacket installer">
    <CardGroup cols={1}>
        <Card title="Repacket Agent (MacOS)" icon="apple" href="https://repacket-installers.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Repacket.pkg" />
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload to your MDM platform">
    Upload the PKG installer to your MDM with the following details:

    Application Name: ```Repacket```

    Publisher: ```Repacket```

    Description: ```Repacket keeps employees safe while browsing online```

    Installation Context: ```System```

    Requires Admin: ```Yes```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download the Network Extension configuration profile">
    MacOS requires a configuration profile to enable Repacket's Network Extension without user interaction.

    <CardGroup cols={1}>
        <Card title="Repacket Network Extension Profile" icon="apple" href="https://repacket-installers.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Repacket.mobileconfig" />
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy the configuration profile">
    Upload the configuration profile to your MDM:

    Profile Name: ```Repacket Network Extension```

    Profile Type: ```Custom```

    Deploy it to the same device groups as the Repacket application.

    **Important**: Ensure the profile is deployed **before** or **simultaneously** with the application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to target devices">
    Deploy both the application and configuration profile to your desired groups:
    - Assign to your desired user groups or device groups
    - Set deployment type to "Required" for automatic installation
    - Configure deployment schedule as needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify deployment">
    After deployment, verify:
    - The Repacket application is installed in `/Library/Repacket/`
    - The Network Extension is approved and enabled
    - Users can browse without additional prompts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Registration Keys (Optional - Silent Enrollment)

For a seamless user experience without login prompts, you can deploy registration keys alongside the application. This is especially useful for AD-joined Windows devices, where Repacket can automatically detect user identity and enroll devices without any user interaction.

Registration keys allow machines to be auto-enrolled in Repacket based on their Active Directory or MDM identity, creating a completely transparent experience for end users.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Windows Issues

**Installation Fails**:
- Verify the installer has proper permissions
- Check if antivirus is blocking the installation
- Ensure sufficient disk space (minimum 100MB)

**Service Not Starting**:
- Check Windows Event Logs for error details
- Verify no conflicting proxy software is installed
- Restart the Repacket service manually

### Common MacOS Issues

**Network Extension Not Approved**:
- Verify the configuration profile was deployed successfully
- Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General for pending approvals
- Redeploy the configuration profile if necessary

**Installation Permission Denied**:
- Ensure the PKG is deployed with system-level permissions
- Check that the MDM has proper device management permissions

**User Prompted for Network Extension**:
- The configuration profile wasn't deployed before the application
- Redeploy the configuration profile and reinstall the application

### Registration Key Issues

**Users Still See Login Prompt**:
- Verify the registration key file exists at the correct path
- Check file permissions (should be readable by system/all users)
- Confirm the registration key is valid and not expired
- For non-AD machines, ensure the registration command was executed

**Identity Not Detected**:
- For AD-joined machines, verify the domain join is working properly
- For non-AD machines, run the registration command with explicit user parameters
