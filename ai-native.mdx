When you host your documentation on Mintlify, built-in AI features help your users find answers and your team maintain content more efficiently. Your content provides the context for these AI-native features to improve the experiences of reading, writing, and discovering your documentation.

## What makes your documentation AI-native

### Reading

hello

In addition to reading individual pages, users can chat with the [assistant](/ai/assistant) in your documentation for immediate answers to their questions and links to relevant content. The assistant helps guide users through your product with accurate information from your documentation. Embed the assistant into custom apps with the [API](/api/assistant/create-assistant-message) to extend where users can access your documentation.

### Writing

The [agent](/agent) helps you write and maintain documentation. It creates pull requests with proposed changes based on your prompts, pull requests, and Slack threads. Add the agent to your Slack workspace so that anyone on your team can help maintain your documentation by chatting with the agent. Or embed the agent into custom apps via the [API](/api/agent/create-agent-job).

You can configure the agent to monitor connected repositories and proactively [suggest](/agent/suggestions) documentation updates when it identifies user-facing changes.

Configure popular tools like [Cursor](/guides/cursor), [Claude Code](/guides/claude-code), and [Windsurf](/guides/windsurf) to reference the Mintlify schema, your style guide, and best practices.

### Discovering

Your site is automatically optimized for AI tools and search engines to help users discover your documentation. All pages send their content as Markdown to AI agents instead of HTML, which helps these tools process your content faster and use fewer tokens. Every page is also available to view as Markdown by appending `.md` to the URL.

Mintlify hosts `llms.txt` and `skill.md` files for your documentation. These industry-standard files help LLMs respond efficiently with relevant information to user queries and provide a list of capabilities for agents to use, so that users are more successful with your product.

Your documentation site also hosts an MCP server that lets users connect your documentation directly to their AI tools for up to date information about your product directly where they want it.

Full-text search and semantic understanding help users and AI tools find relevant information quickly. Search understands user intent rather than just matching keywords. And if a user encounters a 404 error, your site suggests related pages to help them find what they're looking for. No configuration required.
