When you host your documentation on Mintlify, built-in AI features help your users find answers and your team maintain content more efficiently. These AI-native features use the content in your docs to improve the experience of reading, writing, and distributing your docs.

## What makes your docs AI-native

### Content suggestions
Users can chat with the assistant to get answers and links to relevant pages to guide them through using your product. Embed the assistant into custom apps with the [API](api-reference/assistant/create-assistant-message).

If a user encounters a 404 error, your site suggests related pages to help them find what they're looking for. No configuration required.

### Search-optimized
Mintlify automatically hosts `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files for your docs. These files are an industry standard that help LLMs index content. AI tools use these files to process the structure of your documentation and find content relevant to user queries.

Mintlify also hosts an MCP server for your docs site that lets users connect your docs directly to their AI tools so that they have up to date information about your product directly where they want it.

Full-text search and semantic understanding help users and AI tools find relevant information quickly. Search on your docs understands user intent rather than just matching keywords.

### Structured content
Your MDX pages generate semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchies, which makes it easy for AI tools to understand and reference your content. Every page is available as Markdown by appending `.md` to the page's URL.

Page frontmatter—like titles, descriptions, and tags—provides context that helps AI tools understand the purpose and scope of each page.
