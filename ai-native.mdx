When you host your documentation on Mintlify, built-in AI features help your users find answers and your team maintain content more efficiently. Your content provides the context for these AI-native features to improve the experiences of reading, writing, and discovering your docs.

## What makes your docs AI-native

### Reading

In addition to reading individual pages, users can chat with the [assistant](/ai/assistant) in your docs for immediate answers to their questions and links to relevant content. The assistant helps guide people through your product with context from your docs, so people receive accurate information. Embed the assistant into custom apps with the [API](api-reference/assistant/create-assistant-message) to extend where users can access your docs.

### Writing

The [agent](/ai/agent) helps you write and maintain documentation. It creates pull requests with proposed changes based on your prompts, pull requests, and Slack threads. Add the agent to your Slack workspace so that anyone on your team can help maintain your docs by chatting with the agent. Or embed the agent into custom apps via the [API](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job).

### Discovering

Mintlify automatically hosts `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files for your docs. These industry standard files help LLMs index your docs, process the structure of your content efficiently, and respond with relevant information to user queries.

Mintlify also hosts an MCP server for your docs site that lets users connect your docs directly to their AI tools so that they have up to date information about your product directly where they want it.

Full-text search and semantic understanding help users and AI tools find relevant information quickly. Search on your docs understands user intent rather than just matching keywords. And if a user encounters a 404 error, your site suggests related pages to help them find what they're looking for. No configuration required.
