When you host your documentation on Mintlify, built-in AI features help your users find answers and your team maintain content more efficiently.

Here's how these features enhance the user and maintainer experiences of your docs.

## What makes your docs AI-native

Mintlify's AI features analyze your docs to create better experiences for both users and maintainers. For users, they enhance content discovery across the web and AI tools. For maintainers, they assist with writing and updating content.

### Structured content
Your MDX pages generate semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchies, which makes it easy for AI tools to understand and reference your content.

### Rich metadata
Page frontmatter—like titles, descriptions, and tags—provides context that helps AI tools understand the purpose and scope of each page.

### Search-optimized
Full-text search and semantic understanding help users and AI tools find relevant information quickly.

### Content suggestions
The assistant feature can recommend related pages and guide users to relevant information.

### Copy-to-AI workflows
Users can quickly copy content to their preferred AI tools with proper context preservation.
