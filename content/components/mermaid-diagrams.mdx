````md Mermaid Flowchart Example
```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) lets you create visual diagrams using text and code.

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```

You can create the following using Mermaid diagrams:

- Flowchart
- Sequence diagram
- Class diagram
- State diagram
- Entity relationship diagram
- User journey
- and more

For a complete list of diagrams supported by Mermaid, check out their [website](https://mermaid.js.org/).

## Syntax for Mermaid diagrams

To create a flowchart, you can write the Mermaid flowchart inside a Mermaid code block.

```mermaid
// Your mermaid code block here
