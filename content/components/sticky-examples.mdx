The `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` stick code blocks to the top-right of a page even as you scroll. The components work on all pages even if you don't use an API playground.

`<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` show up like regular code blocks on mobile.

## Request Example

The `<RequestExample>` component works similar to [CodeGroup](/content/components/code-groups), but displays the request content on the right sidebar. Thus, you can put multiple code blocks inside `<RequestExample>`.

Please set a name on every code block you put inside RequestExample.

<RequestExample>
````md RequestExample Example
<RequestExample>

```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://dog-api.kinduff.com/api/facts
```

</RequestExample>
````
</RequestExample>

## Response Example

The `<ResponseExample>` component is the same as `<RequestExample>` but will show up underneath it.

<ResponseExample>
````md ResponseExample Example
<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{ "status": "success" }
```

</ResponseExample>
````
</ResponseExample>
