If your API returns different responses based on input parameters, user context, or other conditions of the request, you can document multiple response examples with the `examples` property.

This property can be added to any response and has the following schema.

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: Successful response
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/YourResponseSchema"
        examples:
          us:
            summary: Response for United States
            value:
              countryCode: "US"
              currencyCode: "USD"
              taxRate: 0.0825
          gb:
            summary: Response for United Kingdom
            value:
              countryCode: "GB"
              currencyCode: "GBP"
              taxRate: 0.20
```

## Audio response examples

For endpoints that return audio files, you can provide a URL to an audio file in the `examples` property. The API playground will render an interactive audio player instead of a code snippet.

To configure audio response examples:

1. Set the content type to an `audio/*` media type (e.g., `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/ogg`)
2. Provide a valid URL to an audio file as the example value

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: Audio file generated successfully
    content:
      audio/mpeg:
        schema:
          type: string
          format: binary
        examples:
          sample:
            summary: Sample audio output
            value: "https://example.com/sample-audio.mp3"
```

The audio URL will be embedded in an HTML audio player, allowing users to play the example directly in the documentation.
