If your API returns different responses based on input parameters, user context, or other conditions of the request, you can document multiple response examples with the `examples` property.

The API playground supports various response content types including JSON, text, images, and video.

This property can be added to any response and has the following schema.

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: Successful response
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/YourResponseSchema"
        examples:
          us:
            summary: Response for United States
            value:
              countryCode: "US"
              currencyCode: "USD"
              taxRate: 0.0825
          gb:
            summary: Response for United Kingdom
            value:
              countryCode: "GB"
              currencyCode: "GBP"
              taxRate: 0.20
```

## Video responses

The playground supports video responses. To document an endpoint that returns video content, specify the appropriate video content type in your OpenAPI specification.

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: Video response
    content:
      video/mp4:
        schema:
          type: string
          format: binary
```
