## Add an AsyncAPI specification file

To begin to create pages for your websockets, make sure you have a valid AsyncAPI document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [AsyncAPI specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v3.0.0). Your document must follow AsyncAPI specification 3.0+.
<Tip>To make sure your AsyncAPI spec is valid, you can paste it into the [AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/)</Tip>

## Auto-populate websockets pages

You can add an `asyncapi` field to any tab or group in the navigation of your `docs.json`. This field can contain either the path to an AsyncAPI document in your docs repo, or the URL of a hosted AsyncAPI document. Mintlify will automatically generate a page for each AsyncAPI webhook channel.

**Examples with Tabs:**
```json {5}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "asyncapi": "https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/examples/simple-asyncapi.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Examples with Groups:**
```json {8-11}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Endpoints",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/asyncapi.json",
            "directory": "api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>The directory field is optional. If not specified, the files will be placed in the **api-reference** folder of the docs repo.</Note>

The metadata for the generated pages will contain the key `asyncapi` with a path to the original spec and the channel id so that the page can be generated per channel and display data about all websocket messages sent and received on that channel.
