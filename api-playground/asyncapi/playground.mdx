Autogenerating pages from your AsyncAPI schema will create pages for each channel that display message data that can be sent and received. In the API Playground for websockets, you can connect to websocket servers to send and receive messages.

The API Playground for websockets is enabled by default, but automatically disabled if security schemes are required in the schema. Learn more about playground settings [here](settings/global#param-playground).
