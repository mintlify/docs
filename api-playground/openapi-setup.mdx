OpenAPI is a specification for describing REST APIs. Mintlify supports OpenAPI 3.0+ documents to generate interactive API documentation and keep it up to date.

## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To document your endpoints with OpenAPI, you need a valid OpenAPI document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [OpenAPI specification 3.0\+](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### Describing your API

We reccomend the following resources to learn about and construct your OpenAPI documents.

- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/basic-structure/) to learn the OpenAPI syntax.
- [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) to reference details of the newest OpenAPI specification.
- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to edit, validate, and debug your OpenAPI document.
- The [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to validate your OpenAPI document with the command: `mint openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>`.

<Note>
  Swagger's OpenAPI Guide is for OpenAPI v3.0, but nearly all of the information is applicable to v3.1. For more information on the differences between v3.0 and v3.1, see [Migrating from OpenAPI 3.0 to 3.1.0](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0) in the OpenAPI blog.
</Note>

### Specifying the URL for your API

To enable Mintlify features like the API playground, add a `servers` field to your OpenAPI document with your API's base URL.

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

In an OpenAPI document, different API endpoints are specified by their paths, like `/users/{id}` or simply `/`. The base URL defines where these paths should be appended. For more information on how to configure the `servers` field, see the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/).

The API playground uses these server URLs to determine where to send requests. If multiple servers are specified, a dropdown will allow users to toggle between servers. If no server is specified, the API playground will use simple mode since it cannot send requests without a base.

If your API has endpoints that exist at different URLs, you can [override the server field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/api-host-and-base-path/#overriding-servers) for a given path or operation.

### Specifying authentication

To enable authentication in your API documentation and playground, configure the `securitySchemes` and `security` fields in your OpenAPI document. The API descriptions and API Playground will add authentication fields based on the security configurations in your OpenAPI document.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your authentication method.">
  Add a `securitySchemes` field to define how users authenticate.

  This example shows a configuration for bearer authentication.

  ```json
  {
    "components": {
      "securitySchemes": {
        "bearerAuth": {
        "type": "http",
        "scheme": "bearer"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply authentication to your endpoints.">
  Add a `security` field to require authentication.

  ```json
  {
    "security": [
      {
        "bearerAuth": []
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Common authentication types include:

- [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/): For header, query, or cookie-based keys.
- [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/): For JWT or OAuth tokens.
- [Basic](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/): For username and password

If different endpoints within your API require different methods of authentication, you can [override the security field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#:~:text=you%20can%20apply%20them%20to%20the%20whole%20API%20or%20individual%20operations%20by%20adding%20the%20security%20section%20on%20the%20root%20level%20or%20operation%20level%2C%20respectively.) for a given operation.

For more information on defining and applying authentication, see [Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) in the Swagger documentation.

## Auto-populate API pages

You can add an `openapi` property to any navigation element in your `docs.json` to auto-populate your docs with a page for each specified endpoint. The `openapi` field can contain the path to an OpenAPI document in your docs repo or the URL of a hosted OpenAPI document.

The metadata for the generated pages will have the following default values:

- `title`: The `summary` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present. Otherwise a title generated from the HTTP method and endpoint.
- `description`: The `description` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present.
- `version`: The `version` value from the anchor or tab, if present.
- `deprecated`: The `deprecated` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present. If true, a deprecated label will appear next to the endpoint title in the side navigation and on the endpoint page.

<Tip>
  If you have some endpoints in your OpenAPI schema that you want to exclude from your auto-populated API pages, add the [`x-hidden`](/api-playground/openapi/advanced-features#x-hidden) property to the endpoint.
</Tip>

### Example with tabs

```json {5}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example with groups

```json {8-11}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Endpoints",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/openapi-1.json",
            "directory": "api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The directory field is optional. If not specified, the files will be placed in the `api-reference` directory of the docs repo.
</Note>

## Create `MDX` files for API pages

There are some scenarios in which the default behavior isn't sufficient. If you need more customizability, you can create an MDX page for your OpenAPI operation, and modify it just like any other MDX page.

If you want to customize the page metadata, add additional content, omit certain OpenAPI operations, or reorder OpenAPI pages in your navigation, you'll need an MDX page for each operation. Here is [an example MDX OpenAPI page](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/docs/rest/databases/create-databases.mdx) from [MindsDB](https://docs.mindsdb.com/rest/databases/create-databases). 

![](/images/mindsdb.png)

### Manually specify files

You can always create an MDX page manually, and reference the OpenAPI operation in the page's metadata using the `openapi` field.

<Snippet file="api-playground/openapi.mdx" />

By using the OpenAPI reference, the name, description, parameters, responses,
and the API playground will be automatically generated from the OpenAPI document.

If you have multiple OpenAPI files, include the path to the OpenAPI file to ensure Mintlify finds the correct OpenAPI document. This is not required if you have
only one OpenAPI file - it will automatically detect your OpenAPI file.

If you want to reference an external OpenAPI file using this method, provide the fileâ€™s URL in the docs.json. See [here](https://mintlify.com/docssettings#param-source-4) for the correct format.

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
title: "Get users"
description: "Returns all plants from the system that the user has access to"
openapi: "/path/to/openapi-1.json GET /users"
deprecated: true
version: "1.0"
---
```

```md Format
---
title: "title of the page"
description: "description of the page"
openapi: openapi-file-path method path
deprecated: boolean (not required)
version: "version-string" (not required)
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  In most cases, the method and path must match the method and path specified
  in the OpenAPI document exactly. If the endpoint doesn't exist in the OpenAPI
  file, the page will be empty.

  For webhooks, replace the method (i.e. "POST") with "webhook" (case insensitive)
  and the correct method will be generated.
</Note>

### Autogenerate `MDX` files

For large OpenAPI documents, creating one MDX page for each OpenAPI operation can be a lot of work. To make it easier, we created a local OpenAPI page scraper.

Our Mintlify [scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping)
autogenerates MDX files for your OpenAPI endpoints.

Each generated page will correspond to an OpenAPI operation under the "paths" section of the OpenAPI schema.
If your OpenAPI document is version 3.1\+, the scraper will also generate pages for webhooks under the "webhooks" section of the OpenAPI schema.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file>
```

Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is
not specified, the files will populate in the working directory.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```

Learn more about our scraping package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping).

The scraper will output an array of
[Navigation entries](settings#structure) containing your OpenAPI MDX
files. You can either append these entries to your existing Navigation, or
reorder and add the files to your navigation manually.

<Note>
  If your OpenAPI document is invalid, the files will not autogenerate.
</Note>

## Create MDX files for OpenAPI schemas

Mintlify also allows you to create individual pages for any OpenAPI schema
defined in an OpenAPI document's `components.schemas` field:

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
openapi-schema: OrderItem
---
```


```md Format
---
openapi-schema: "schema-key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>
