## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To describe your endpoints with OpenAPI, make sure you have a valid OpenAPI
document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the
[OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). Your document must
follow OpenAPI specification 3.0\+.
<Tip>
  To validate your OpenAPI spec, use our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) and run this command: \
  `mint openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>`
</Tip>


## Auto-populate API pages

The fastest way to get started with OpenAPI is to add an `openapi` field to a tab in the `docs.json`. This field can contain either the path to an OpenAPI document in your docs repo, or the URL of a hosted OpenAPI document. Mintlify will automatically generate a page for each OpenAPI operation and place them in the tab.

**Example with Tabs:**

```json {5}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The above example is with tabs but you can add an `openapi` property to any [navigation division](/navigation)
</Note>

**Example with Groups:**

```json {8-11}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Endpoints",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/openapi-1.json",
            "directory": "api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The directory field is optional. If not specified, the files will be placed in the **api-reference** folder of the docs repo.
</Note>

When using this option, the metadata for the generated pages will have the following default values:

- `title`: The `summary` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present. Otherwise a title generated from the HTTP method and endpoint.
- `description`: The `description` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present.
- `version`: The `version` value from the anchor or tab, if present.
- `deprecated`: The `deprecated` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present. If true, a deprecated label will appear next to the endpoint in the side navigation and next to the title of the endpoint page.

There are some scenarios in which the default behavior isn't sufficient. If you need more customizability, you can create an MDX page for your OpenAPI operation, and modify it just like any other MDX page.

<Tip>
  If you have some endpoints in your OpenAPI schema that you don't want pages generated for automatically, you can add the [x-hidden](/api-playground/openapi/advanced-features#x-hidden) property
</Tip>

## Create MDX files for API pages

If you want to customize the page metadata, add additional content, omit certain OpenAPI operations, or reorder OpenAPI pages in your navigation, you'll need an MDX page for each operation. Here is [an example MDX OpenAPI page](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/docs/rest/databases/create-databases.mdx) from [MindsDB](https://docs.mindsdb.com/rest/databases/create-databases).

### Manually specify files

You can always create an MDX page manually, and reference the OpenAPI operation in the page's metadata using the `openapi` field.

<Snippet file="api-playground/openapi.mdx" />

By using the OpenAPI reference, the name, description, parameters, responses,
and the API playground will be automatically generated from the OpenAPI document.

If you have multiple OpenAPI files, include the path to the OpenAPI file to ensure Mintlify finds the correct OpenAPI document. This is not required if you have
only one OpenAPI file - it will automatically detect your OpenAPI file.

If you want to reference an external OpenAPI file using this method, provide the fileâ€™s URL in the docs.json. See [here](https://mintlify.com/docssettings#param-source-4) for the correct format.

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
title: "Get users"
description: "Returns all plants from the system that the user has access to"
openapi: "/path/to/openapi-1.json GET /users"
deprecated: true
version: "1.0"
---
```


```md Format
---
title: "title of the page"
description: "description of the page"
openapi: openapi-file-path method path
deprecated: boolean (not required)
version: "version-string" (not required)
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  In most cases, the method and path must match the method and path specified
  in the OpenAPI document exactly. If the endpoint doesn't exist in the OpenAPI
  file, the page will be empty.

  For webhooks, replace the method (i.e. "POST") with "webhook" (case insensitive)
  and the correct method will be generated.
</Note>

### Autogenerate files

For large OpenAPI documents, creating one MDX page for each OpenAPI operation can be a lot of work. To make it easier, we created a local OpenAPI page scraper.

Our Mintlify [scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping)
autogenerates MDX files for your OpenAPI endpoints.

Each generated page will correspond to an OpenAPI operation under the "paths" section of the OpenAPI schema.
If your OpenAPI document is version 3.1\+, the scraper will also generate pages for webhooks under the "webhooks" section of the OpenAPI schema.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file>
```

Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is
not specified, the files will populate in the working directory.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```

Learn more about our scraping package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping).

The scraper will output an array of
[Navigation entries](settings#structure) containing your OpenAPI MDX
files. You can either append these entries to your existing Navigation, or
reorder and add the files to your navigation manually.

<Note>
  If your OpenAPI document is invalid, the files will not autogenerate.
</Note>

## Create MDX files for OpenAPI schemas

Mintlify also allows you to create individual pages for any OpenAPI schema
defined in an OpenAPI document's `components.schemas` field:

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
openapi-schema: OrderItem
---
```


```md Format
---
openapi-schema: "schema-key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

## Describing your API

There are many great tools online for learning about and constructing OpenAPI documents. Here are our favorites:
- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) for familiarizing yourself with the OpenAPI syntax
- [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) for all the details about the newest OpenAPI specification
- [Swagger & OpenAPI Validator](https://editor.swagger.io/) for debugging your OpenAPI document
- [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) for seeing examples in action

<Note>
  Swagger's OpenAPI Guide is for OpenAPI v3.0, but nearly all of the information is applicable to v3.1. For more information on the differences between v3.0 and v3.1, check out [OpenAPI's blog post](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0).
</Note>

## Specifying the URL for your API

In an OpenAPI document, different API endpoints are specified by their paths, like `/users/{id}`, or maybe simply `/`. To specify the base URL to which these paths should be appended, OpenAPI provides the `servers` field. This field is necessary to use some Mintlify features like the API Playground. Read how to configure the `servers` field in the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/).

The API Playground will use these server URLs to determine where to send requests. If multiple servers are specified, a dropdown will appear to allow toggling between servers. If no server is supplied, the API Playground will use simple mode, as there is no way to send a request.

If different endpoints within your API exist at different URLs, you can [override the server field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/#:~:text=%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%2D%20southeastasia-,Overriding%20Servers,-The%20global%20servers) for a given path or operation.

## Specifying authentication

Nearly all APIs require some method of authentication. OpenAPI provides the `securitySchemes` field for defining the methods of authentication used throughout your API, with simple configuration for the most common authentication types - [Basic](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/), [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/), and [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/). To apply these authentication methods to your endpoints, OpenAPI uses the `security` field. The syntax for defining and applying authentication is a bit unintuitive, so definitely check out [Swagger's documentation and examples](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) on the topic.

The API descriptions and API Playground will add authentication fields based on the security configurations in your OpenAPI document.

If different endpoints within your API require different methods of authentication, you can [override the security field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#:~:text=you%20can%20apply%20them%20to%20the%20whole%20API%20or%20individual%20operations%20by%20adding%20the%20security%20section%20on%20the%20root%20level%20or%20operation%20level%2C%20respectively.) for a given operation.
