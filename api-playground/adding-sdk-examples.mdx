If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can use the `x-codeSamples` extension to add code samples to your OpenAPI document and display them in your OpenAPI pages.

SDK examples appear alongside the default cURL examples in your API playground, making it easier for developers to integrate with your API using their preferred language or framework.

This property can be added to any request method and has the following schema.

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The language of the code sample.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  The label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The source code of the sample.
</ParamField>

Here is an example of code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```yaml
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      # ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```

## Multiple SDK languages

You can provide examples in multiple programming languages to support different developer audiences. Common languages include:

<CodeGroup>

```yaml Python example
x-codeSamples:
  - lang: python
    label: Get user by ID
    source: |
      import requests
      
      response = requests.get(
          'https://api.example.com/users/123',
          headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'}
      )
      user = response.json()
```

```yaml JavaScript example
x-codeSamples:
  - lang: javascript
    label: Get user by ID
    source: |
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/users/123', {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
        }
      });
      const user = await response.json();
```

```yaml Go example
x-codeSamples:
  - lang: go
    label: Get user by ID
    source: |
      client := &http.Client{}
      req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.example.com/users/123", nil)
      req.Header.Add("Authorization", "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN")
      resp, _ := client.Do(req)
```

```yaml Ruby example
x-codeSamples:
  - lang: ruby
    label: Get user by ID
    source: |
      require 'net/http'
      require 'json'
      
      uri = URI('https://api.example.com/users/123')
      req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
      req['Authorization'] = 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
      response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
        http.request(req)
      end
      user = JSON.parse(response.body)
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use realistic examples">
    Provide examples that reflect actual use cases rather than placeholder code. Include error handling and common patterns your users will need.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep examples concise">
    Focus on the essential code needed to make the API call. Avoid unnecessary boilerplate that distracts from the core functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match your SDK">
    If you provide official SDKs, ensure the examples match your SDK's actual API and conventions. Keep examples updated when your SDK changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include authentication">
    Show how to properly authenticate requests in each language, as authentication patterns vary significantly across SDKs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add helpful labels">
    Use descriptive labels when providing multiple examples for the same endpoint to help users find the right example quickly.
  </Accordion>
