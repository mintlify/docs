## Overview

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test and explore your API endpoints. Developers can craft API requests, submit them, and view responses without leaving your documentation.

See [Trigger an update](/api/update/trigger) for an example of the API playground in action.

The playground generates interactive pages for your endpoints based on your OpenAPI specification or AsyncAPI schema. If you modify your API, the playground automatically updates the relevant pages.

We recommend generating your API playground from an OpenAPI specification. However, you can manually create API reference pages after defining a base URL and authentication method in your `docs.json`.

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your OpenAPI specification file.">
    <Tip>
    Validate your OpenAPI specification file using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) command `mint openapi-check <filename>`.
    </Tip>

    ```bash {3}
    /your-project
      |- docs.json
      |- openapi.json
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate endpoint pages.">
    Update your `docs.json` to reference your OpenAPI specification.
    
    **To automatically generate pages for all endpoints in your OpenAPI specification**, add an `openapi` property to any navigation element.

    This example generates a page for each endpoint specified in `openapi.json` and organizes the pages in the "API reference" group.

    ```json Generate all endpoint pages
    "navigation": {
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "API reference",
          "openapi": "openapi.json"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    **To generate pages for only specific endpoints**, list the endpoints in the `pages` property of the navigation element.

    This example generates pages for only the `GET /users` and `POST /users` endpoints. To generate other endpoint pages, add additional endpoints to the `pages` array.
    
    ```json Generate specific endpoint pages
    "navigation": {
      "groups": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "openapi.json",
            "pages": [
              "GET /users",
              "POST /users"
            ]
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize your playground

Customize your API playground by defining the following properties in your `docs.json`.

<ResponseField name="playground" type="object">
    Configurations for the API playground.
    <Expandable title="playground" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="display" type="&quot;interactive&quot; | &quot;simple&quot; | &quot;none&quot; | &quot;auth&quot;">
        The display mode of the API playground.
        - `"interactive"`: Display the interactive playground.
        - `"simple"`: Display a copyable endpoint with no playground.
        - `"none"`: Display nothing.
        - `"auth"`: Dynamically show the interactive playground to authenticated users whose groups match the page's groups metadata, and hide it for users without matching groups.

        Defaults to `interactive`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="proxy" type="boolean" defaultOpen="True">
        Whether to pass API requests through a proxy server. Defaults to `true`.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="examples" type="object">
    Configurations for the autogenerated API examples.
    <Expandable title="examples" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="languages" type="array of string">
        Example languages for the autogenerated API snippets.

        Languages display in the order specified.
    </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="defaults" type="&quot;required&quot; | &quot;all&quot;">
        Whether to show optional parameters in API examples. Defaults to `all`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="prefill" type="boolean">
        Whether to prefill the API playground with data from schema examples. When enabled, the playground automatically populates request fields with example values from your OpenAPI specification. Defaults to `false`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="autogenerate" type="boolean">
        Whether to generate code samples for endpoints from API specifications. Defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, only manually-written code samples (from `x-codeSamples` in OpenAPI specifications or `<RequestExample>` components in MDX) appear in the API playground.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Example configuration

This example configures the API playground to be interactive with example code snippets for cURL, Python, and JavaScript. Only required parameters are shown in the code snippets, and the playground prefills the request body with example values.

```json
{
 "api": {
   "playground": {
     "display": "interactive"
   },
   "examples": {
     "languages": ["curl", "python", "javascript"],
     "defaults": "required",
     "prefill": true
   }
 }
}
```

### Authentication-based playground display

Use `playground: "auth"` to control playground visibility based on user authentication and group membership. This is useful for restricting interactive API testing to specific user groups.

When `playground` is set to `"auth"`:
- If the page has `groups` metadata and the authenticated user's groups match, the playground displays as `"interactive"`
- If the user's groups don't match the page's groups, the playground displays as `"none"`
- If the page has no `groups` metadata, authenticated users see the playground as `"interactive"`

```mdx Example with groups
---
title: "Admin endpoint"
openapi: "POST /admin/users"
playground: "auth"
public: true
groups: ["admin", "superuser"]
---
```

In this example:
- Users in the "admin" or "superuser" groups see the interactive playground
- Users not in these groups see no playground
- The `public: true` metadata allows non-authenticated users to view the page (but not the playground)

### Custom endpoint pages

When you need more control over your API documentation, use the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification or create individual MDX pages for your endpoints.

Both options allow you to:

- Customize page metadata
- Add additional content like examples
- Control playground behavior per page

The `x-mint` extension is recommended so that all of your API documentation is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification and maintained in one file.

Individual MDX pages are recommended for small APIs or when you want to experiment with changes on a per-page basis.
