## Overview

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test and explore your API endpoints. Developers can craft API requests, submit them, and view responses without leaving your documentation. Select the **Try it** button to demo the API playground.

TODO: put the example here
openapi: 'POST /project/update/{projectId}'
hideApiMarker: true

The playground is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification, MDX configuration, or AsyncAPI schema so any updates to your API are automatically reflected in the playground.

You can customize the interface, authentication methods, and server support of your playground.

## Getting Started

We recommend generating your API playground from an OpenAPI specification.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your OpenAPI specification file.">
    You will need a valid OpenAPI specification file in your project. See [Writing OpenAPI](/api-playground/openapi/writing-openapi) for more information.

    ``` {2}
    /your-project
      |- docs.json
      |- openapi.json
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure `docs.json`.">
    Update your `docs.json` to reference your OpenAPI specification. In this example, Mintlify will generate a page for each endpoint specified in `openapi.json` and organize them under the "API reference" group in your navigation.

    ```json
    {
        "navigation": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "openapi.json"
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Common Issues and Solutions

- Requests from the API playground are not working

If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By default, requests made via the API Playground start with a POST request to the /api/request path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow GET requests, then all of these requests will fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to allow POST requests to the /api/request path.

Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting POST requests, you can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the api.playground.proxy setting in the docs.json, as described here. This will likely require you to configure CORS on your server, as these requests will now come directly from your usersâ€™ browsers.
