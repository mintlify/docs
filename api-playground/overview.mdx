## Overview

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test and explore your API endpoints. Developers can craft API requests, submit them, and view responses without leaving your documentation.

The playground is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification or AsyncAPI schema so any updates to your API are automatically reflected in the playground. You can also manually create API reference pages after defining a base URL and authentication method in your `docs.json`.

We recommend generating your API playground from an OpenAPI specification. See [OpenAPI Setup](/api-playground/openapi-setup) for more information on creating your OpenAPI document.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your OpenAPI specification file.">
    <Info>
    Make sure that your OpenAPI specification file is valid using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint).
    </Info>

    ```bash {2}
    /your-project
      |- docs.json
      |- openapi.json
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure `docs.json`.">
    Update your `docs.json` to reference your OpenAPI specification. Add an `openapi` property to any navigation element to auto-populate your docs with pages for each endpoint specified in your OpenAPI document.

    This example generates a page for each endpoint specified in `openapi.json` and organize them under the "API reference" group in your navigation.

    ```json
    {
        "navigation": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "openapi.json"
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing your playground

You can customize your API playground by defining the following properties in your `docs.json`.

<ResponseField name="playground" type="object">
    Configurations for the API playground.
    <Expandable title="playground" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="display" type="&quot;interactive&quot; | &quot;simple&quot; | &quot;none&quot;">
        The display mode of the API playground.
        - `"interactive"`: Display the interactive playground.
        - `"simple"`: Display a copyable endpoint with no playground.
        - `"none"`: Display nothing.

        Defaults to `interactive`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="proxy" type="boolean" defaultOpen="True">
        Whether to pass API requests through a proxy server. Defaults to `true`.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="examples" type="object">
    Configurations for the autogenerated API examples.
    <Expandable title="examples" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="languages" type="array of string">
        Example languages for the autogenerated API snippets.

        Languages display in the order specified.
    </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="defaults" type="&quot;required&quot; | &quot;all&quot;">
        Whether to show optional parameters in API examples. Defaults to `all`.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Example configuration

```json
{
 "api": {
   "playground": {
     "display": "interactive"
   },
   "examples": {
     "languages": ["curl", "python", "javascript"],
     "defaults": "required"
   }
 }
}
```

This example configures the API playground to be interactive with example code snippets for cURL, Python, and JavaScript. Only required parameters are shown in the code snippets.

### Custom endpoint pages

When you need more control over your API documentation, use the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification or create individual `MDX` pages for your endpoints.

Both options allow you to:

- Customize page metadata
- Add additional content like examples
- Control playground behavior per page

The `x-mint` extension is recommended so that all of your API documentation is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification and maintained in one file.

Individual `MDX` pages are recommended for small APIs or when you want to experiment with changes on a per-page basis.

For more information, see [x-mint extension](/api-playground/openapi-setup#x-mint-extension) and [MDX Setup](/api-playground/mdx/configuration).
