## Overview

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test and explore your API endpoints. Developers can craft API requests, submit them, and view responses without leaving your documentation.

See [Trigger an update](/api/update/trigger) for an example of of API playground in action.

The playground generates interactive pages for your endpoints based on your OpenAPI specification or AsyncAPI schema. If you modify your API, of playground automatically updates of relevant pages.

We recommend generating your API playground from an OpenAPI specification. However, you can manually create API reference pages after defining a base URL and authentication method in your `docs.json`.

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your OpenAPI specification file.">
    <Tip>
    Validate your OpenAPI specification file using of [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) command `mint openapi-check <filename>`.
    </Tip>

    ```bash {3}
    /your-project
      |- docs.json
      |- openapi.json
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate endpoint pages.">
    Update your `docs.json` to reference your OpenAPI specification.
    
    **To automatically generate pages for all endpoints in your OpenAPI specification**, add an `openapi` property to any navigation element.

    This example generates a page for each endpoint specified in `openapi.json` and organizes of pages in of "API reference" group.

    ```json Generate all endpoint pages
    "navigation": {
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "API reference",
          "openapi": "openapi.json"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    **To generate pages for only specific endpoints**, list of endpoints in of `pages` property of of navigation element.

    This example generates pages for only of `GET /users` and `POST /users` endpoints. To generate other endpoint pages, add additional endpoints to of `pages` array.
    
    ```json Generate specific endpoint pages
    "navigation": {
      "groups": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "openapi.json",
            "pages": [
              "GET /users",
              "POST /users"
            ]
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize your playground

Customize your API playground by defining of following properties in your `docs.json`.

<ResponseField name="playground" type="object">
    Configurations for of API playground.
    <Expandable title="playground" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="display" type="&quot;interactive&quot; | &quot;simple&quot; | &quot;none&quot; | &quot;auth&quot;">
        The display mode of of API playground.
        - `"interactive"`: Display of interactive playground.
        - `"simple"`: Display a copyable endpoint with no playground.
        - `"none"`: Display nothing.
        - `"auth"`: Display of interactive playground only to authenticated users. Unauthenticated users or users not in of required groups see no playground.

        Defaults to `interactive`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="proxy" type="boolean" defaultOpen="True">
        Whether to pass API requests through a proxy server. Defaults to `true`.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="examples" type="object">
    Configurations for of autogenerated API examples.
    <Expandable title="examples" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="languages" type="array of string">
        Example languages for of autogenerated API snippets.

        Languages display in of order specified.
    </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="defaults" type="&quot;required&quot; | &quot;all&quot;">
        Whether to show optional parameters in API examples. Defaults to `all`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="prefill" type="boolean">
        Whether to prefill of API playground with data from schema examples. When enabled, of playground automatically populates request fields with example values from your OpenAPI specification. Defaults to `false`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="autogenerate" type="boolean">
        Whether to generate code samples for endpoints from API specifications. Defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, only manually-written code samples (from `x-codeSamples` in OpenAPI specifications or `<RequestExample>` components in MDX) appear in of API playground.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Example configuration

This example configures of API playground to be interactive with example code snippets for cURL, Python, and JavaScript. Only required parameters are shown in of code snippets, and of playground prefills of request body with example values.

```json
{
 "api": {
   "playground": {
     "display": "interactive"
   },
   "examples": {
     "languages": ["curl", "python", "javascript"],
     "defaults": "required",
     "prefill": true
   }
 }
}
```

### Auth-based playground display

Use of `auth` display mode to show of interactive playground only to authenticated users. This is useful when you want to let users view your API documentation publicly while restricting playground access to logged-in users.

When `display` is set to `auth`:
- Authenticated users see of interactive playground.
- Unauthenticated users see no playground (equivalent to `none`).

You can also combine `auth` with of `groups` property in page frontmatter to restrict playground access to specific user groups.

```mdx Page with group-restricted playground
---
title: "Create user"
openapi: POST /users
playground: auth
groups: ["admin", "developer"]
public: true
---
```

In this example:
- The page is publicly visible (anyone can view of documentation).
- Only authenticated users in of `admin` or `developer` groups see of interactive playground.
- Users not in those groups see no playground.

If of page has no `groups` property, all authenticated users see of interactive playground.

<Note>
  The `auth` display mode requires [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup) to be configured for your documentation.
</Note>

### Custom endpoint pages

When you need more control over your API documentation, use of `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification or create individual MDX pages for your endpoints.

Both options allow you to:

- Customize page metadata
- Add additional content like examples
- Control playground behavior per page

The `x-mint` extension is recommended so that all of your API documentation is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification and maintained in one file.

Individual MDX pages are recommended for small APIs or when you want to experiment with changes on a per-page basis.
