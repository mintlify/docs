title: "Adding SDK examples"
description: "Display language-specific code samples alongside your API endpoints to show developers how to use your SDKs"
---

If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can use the `x-codeSamples` extension to add code samples to your OpenAPI document and display them in your OpenAPI pages.

This property can be added to any request method and has the following schema.

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The language of the code sample.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  The label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The source code of the sample.
</ParamField>

Here is an example of code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```yaml
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      # ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```
