If your API pages aren't displaying correctly, check these common configuration issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    In this scenario, it's likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
    or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

    Running `mint dev` locally should reveal some of these issues.

    To verify your OpenAPI document will pass validation:

    1. Visit [this validator](https://editor.swagger.io/)
    2. Switch to the "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it\!"

    If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
    This is the exact validation package Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents, so if your document
    passes validation here, there's a great chance the problem is elsewhere.

    Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
    you could encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) (under Edit \> Convert to OpenAPI 3):

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    This is usually caused by a misspelled `openapi` field in the page metadata. Make sure
    the HTTP method and path match the HTTP method and path in the OpenAPI document exactly.

    Here's an example of how things might go wrong:

    ```mdx get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
    ---
    ```

    ```yaml openapi.yaml
    paths:
      "/users/{id}":
        get: ...
    ```

    Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, whereas the path in the OpenAPI
    document does not.

    Another common issue is a misspelled filename. If you are specifying a particular OpenAPI document
    in the `openapi` field, ensure the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
    documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata might look like this:

    ```mdx api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
    ---
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
    default, requests made via the API Playground start with a `POST` request to the
    `/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
    requests, then all of these requests will fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to
    allow `POST` requests to the `/api/request` path.

    Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the `api.playground.proxy` setting in the `docs.json`, as described in the [settings documentation](/settings#param-proxy). When using this configuration, you will need to configure CORS on your server since requests will come directly from users' browsers rather than through your proxy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OpenAPI navigation entries are not generating pages">
    If you are using an OpenAPI navigation configuration, but the pages aren't generating, check these common issues:

    1. **Missing default OpenAPI spec**: Ensure you have an `openapi` field set for the navigation element:
      ```json {5}
      "navigation": {
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
            "pages": [
              "GET /users",
              "POST /users"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    2. **OpenAPI spec inheritance**: If using nested navigation, ensure child groups inherit the correct OpenAPI spec or specify their own.

    3. **Validation issues**: Use `mint openapi-check <path-to-openapi-file>` to verify your OpenAPI document is valid.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Some OpenAPI operations appear in navigation but others don't">

    1. **Hidden operations**: Operations marked with `x-hidden: true` in your OpenAPI spec won't appear in auto-generated navigation.
    2. **Invalid operations**: Operations with validation errors in the OpenAPI spec may be skipped. Check your OpenAPI document for syntax errors.
    3. **Manual vs automatic inclusion**: If you reference any endpoints from an OpenAPI spec, only the explicitly referenced operations will appear in navigation. No other pages will be automatically added. This includes operations that are referenced in child navigation elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mixed navigation (OpenAPI and MDX pages) not working correctly">
    When combining OpenAPI operations with regular documentation pages in navigation:

    1. **File conflicts**: You cannot have both an `MDX` file and a navigation entry for the same operation. For example, if you have `get-users.mdx`, do not also include `"GET /users"` in your navigation.  If you need to have a file that shares a name with an operation, use the `x-mint` extension for the endpoint to have the href point to a different location.
    2. **Path resolution**: Navigation entries that don't match OpenAPI operations will be treated as file paths. Ensure your `MDX` files exist at the expected locations.
    3. **Case sensitivity**: OpenAPI operation matching is case-sensitive. Ensure HTTP methods are uppercase in navigation entries.
