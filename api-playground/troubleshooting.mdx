If your API pages aren't displaying correctly, check these common configuration issues.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    In this scenario, it's likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
    or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

    Running `mint dev` locally should reveal some of these issues.

    To verify your OpenAPI document passes validation:

    1. Visit [this validator](https://editor.swagger.io/)
    2. Switch to the "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it\!"

    If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
    This is the exact validation package Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents, so if your document
    passes validation here, there's a great chance the problem is elsewhere.

    Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
    you could encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) (under Edit \> Convert to OpenAPI 3):

    <Frame>
      ![Screenshot of the Swagger Editor with the Edit menu expanded and the "Convert to OpenAPI 3" menu item highlighted.](/images/convert-oas-3.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    This is usually caused by a misspelled `openapi` field in the page metadata. Make sure
    the HTTP method and path match the HTTP method and path in the OpenAPI document exactly.

    Here's an example of how things might go wrong:

    ```mdx get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
    ---
    ```

    ```yaml openapi.yaml
    paths:
      "/users/{id}":
        get: ...
    ```

    Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, whereas the path in the OpenAPI
    document does not.

    Another common issue is a misspelled filename. If you are specifying a particular OpenAPI document
    in the `openapi` field, ensure the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
    documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata might look like this:

    ```mdx api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
    ---
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
    default, requests made via the API Playground start with a `POST` request to the
    `/_mintlify/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
    requests, then all of these requests fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to
    allow `POST` requests to the `/_mintlify/api/request` path.

    Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the `api.playground.proxy` setting in the `docs.json`, as described in the [settings documentation](/organize/settings#param-proxy). When using this configuration, you must configure CORS on your server since requests come directly from users' browsers rather than through your proxy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OpenAPI navigation entries are not generating pages">
    If you are using an OpenAPI navigation configuration, but the pages aren't generating, check these common issues:

    1. **Missing default OpenAPI spec**: Ensure you have an `openapi` field set for the navigation element:
      ```json {5}
      "navigation": {
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
            "pages": [
              "GET /users",
              "POST /users"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    2. **OpenAPI spec inheritance**: If using nested navigation, ensure child groups inherit the correct OpenAPI spec or specify their own.

    3. **Validation issues**: Use `mint openapi-check <path-to-openapi-file>` to verify your OpenAPI document is valid.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Some OpenAPI operations appear in navigation but others don't">

    1. **Hidden operations**: Operations marked with `x-hidden: true` in your OpenAPI spec won't appear in auto-generated navigation.
    2. **Invalid operations**: Operations with validation errors in the OpenAPI spec may be skipped. Check your OpenAPI document for syntax errors.
    3. **Manual vs automatic inclusion**: If you reference any endpoints from an OpenAPI spec, only the explicitly referenced operations will appear in navigation. No other pages will be automatically added. This includes operations that are referenced in child navigation elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mixed navigation (OpenAPI and MDX pages) not working correctly">
    When combining OpenAPI operations with regular documentation pages in navigation:

    1. **File conflicts**: You cannot have both an `MDX` file and a navigation entry for the same operation. For example, if you have `get-users.mdx`, do not also include `"GET /users"` in your navigation. If you need to have a file that shares a name with an operation, use the `x-mint` extension for the endpoint to have the href point to a different location.
    2. **Path resolution**: Navigation entries that don't match OpenAPI operations will be treated as file paths. Ensure your `MDX` files exist at the expected locations.
    3. **Case sensitivity**: OpenAPI operation matching is case-sensitive. Ensure HTTP methods are uppercase in navigation entries.
  </Accordion>

## OpenAPI validation errors

When running `mint openapi-check` or `mint dev`, you may encounter validation errors that prevent your API documentation from generating correctly. This section explains common validation errors and how to fix them.

### Understanding validation error messages

OpenAPI validation errors include a JSON path that shows exactly where the error occurred in your specification. The path uses forward slashes to indicate nested properties.

**Error format:**
```
error Failed to validate OpenAPI schema: /path/to/operation/property: error message
```

**Example:**
```
error Failed to validate OpenAPI schema: /shot/get/responses/200: must have required property $ref
```

This error indicates:
- **Path**: `/shot` (the endpoint path)
- **Method**: `get` (the HTTP method)
- **Location**: `responses/200` (the 200 response definition)
- **Issue**: Missing required `$ref` property

### Response schema validation errors

Response objects in OpenAPI must follow specific rules. The most common issue is incorrectly defining response schemas.

#### Missing $ref in response

**Error:**
```
/users/get/responses/200: must have required property $ref
```

**Incorrect:**
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "get": {
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "Successful response",
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "id": { "type": "string" },
              "name": { "type": "string" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "get": {
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "Successful response",
            "content": {
              "application/json": {
                "schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "id": { "type": "string" },
                    "name": { "type": "string" }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key differences:**
- Response schemas must be wrapped in `content` → `application/json` → `schema`
- Schema properties (`type`, `properties`) cannot be direct children of the response object
- The `description` field is required for all response objects

#### Using $ref for reusable schemas

**Correct with $ref:**
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "get": {
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "Successful response",
            "content": {
              "application/json": {
                "schema": {
                  "$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "components": {
    "schemas": {
      "User": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "id": { "type": "string" },
          "name": { "type": "string" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Common $ref errors

#### Invalid $ref path

**Error:**
```
/users/post/requestBody/content/application~1json/schema/$ref: can't resolve reference
```

**Incorrect:**
```json
{
  "schema": {
    "$ref": "#/components/schema/User"
  }
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "schema": {
    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"
  }
}
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Using `schema` instead of `schemas` (note the plural)
- Missing the `#/` prefix
- Referencing a component that doesn't exist
- Typos in the component name (case-sensitive)

#### External $ref not supported

**Error:**
```
External references are not supported
```

**Incorrect:**
```json
{
  "schema": {
    "$ref": "https://example.com/schemas/user.json"
  }
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "schema": {
    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"
  }
}
```

Mintlify only supports internal references within a single OpenAPI document. Move external schemas into your `components.schemas` section.

#### Circular $ref

**Error:**
```
Circular reference detected
```

This occurs when schemas reference each other in a loop. While some tools support circular references, they can cause issues. Restructure your schemas to avoid circular dependencies.

### Request body validation errors

#### Missing content wrapper

**Error:**
```
/users/post/requestBody: must have required property content
```

**Incorrect:**
```json
{
  "requestBody": {
    "description": "User object",
    "schema": {
      "$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"
    }
  }
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "requestBody": {
    "description": "User object",
    "required": true,
    "content": {
      "application/json": {
        "schema": {
          "$ref": "#/components/schemas/User"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Parameter validation errors

#### Invalid parameter location

**Error:**
```
/users/get/parameters/0/in: must be equal to one of the allowed values
```

**Incorrect:**
```json
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "userId",
      "in": "body",
      "schema": { "type": "string" }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Correct:**
```json
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "userId",
      "in": "path",
      "required": true,
      "schema": { "type": "string" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Valid `in` values: `query`, `header`, `path`, `cookie`. Note that `body` is not valid for parameters in OpenAPI 3.0+. Use `requestBody` instead.

### Troubleshooting workflow

When `mint openapi-check` fails with validation errors, follow this workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run validation">
    ```bash
    mint openapi-check <path-to-openapi-file>
    ```
    
    This command validates your OpenAPI specification and shows all errors.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify the error location">
    Parse the JSON path in the error message to locate the exact operation and property:
    
    ```
    /users/{id}/get/responses/200/content/application~1json/schema
    ```
    
    - Path: `/users/{id}`
    - Method: `get`
    - Location: `responses` → `200` → `content` → `application/json` → `schema`
    
    Note: `~1` in the path represents a forward slash (`/`) that's been escaped.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check the OpenAPI specification">
    Review the [OpenAPI 3.0 specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) for the correct structure:
    
    - [Response Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#response-object)
    - [Schema Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object)
    - [Parameter Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object)
    - [Request Body Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#request-body-object)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate with external tools">
    Use the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to validate and debug:
    
    1. Visit [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/)
    2. Click "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it!"
    
    A green border indicates successful validation. The Swagger Editor uses the same validation package as Mintlify.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix and re-validate">
    After making corrections, run `mint openapi-check` again to verify all errors are resolved.
  </Step>
</Steps>
