## Enabling authentication

You can add an authentication method to your `docs.json` to enable it globally on every page or you can set it on a per-page basis.

A page's authentication method will override a global method if both are set.

### Bearer token (JWT)

Bearer token authentication is commonly used with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). When you enable bearer authentication, users can provide their JWT tokens to authenticate API requests directly from your documentation.

JWTs are a secure, stateless way to authenticate users and are widely adopted across modern APIs. The bearer token method automatically handles JWT authentication by including the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "bearer"
      }
    }
}
```

```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "bearer"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
When using JWT authentication, users will see an input field where they can paste their JWT token. The token is stored securely in the browser and automatically included in all API requests made from your documentation.

### Basic authentication

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "basic"
      }
    }
}
```

```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "basic"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### API key

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "key",
        "name": "x-api-key"
      }
    }
}
```

```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### None

The "none" authentication method is useful to disable authentication on a specific endpoint after setting a default in docs.json.

<CodeGroup>
```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "none"
---
```
</CodeGroup>
