description: 'Generate docs pages for your API endpoints using MDX'
---

Mintlify allows you to define your API endpoints using a combination of `docs.json` configuration, MDX metadata fields, and the `<ParamFields />` component. From the defined endpoints, we generate an API playground, request examples, and response examples.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your API">
    In your `docs.json` file, define your base URL and auth method:

    ```json
     "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "server": "https://mintlify.com/api", // string array for multiple base URLs
        "auth": {
          "method": "key",
          "name": "x-api-key" // options: bearer, basic, key.
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you would not like to show an API playground, you don't need to include auth types. Hide the playground with the following field:

    ```json
    "api": {
      "playground": {
        "display": "none"
      }
    }
    ```

    Find a full list of API configurations [here](/settings/global#param-api).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create your endpoint pages">

    Each API endpoint page should have a corresponding MDX file. At the top of each file, define:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    ---
    ```

    You can specify path parameters by adding the parameter name to the path, wrapped with `{}`:

    ```bash
    https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
    ```

    <Note>

    If you have `server` configured in [docs.json](/settings/global), you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.

    </Note>

    You can also override the globally-defined display mode for the API playground per page by adding `playground` at the top of the MDX file:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    playground: 'none'
    ```
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your endpoints to your docs">
    Add your endpoint pages to the sidebar by adding the paths to the `navigation` field in your `docs.json`. Learn more about structuring your docs [here](/settings/navigation).
