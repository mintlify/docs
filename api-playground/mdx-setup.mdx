You can manually define API endpoints in individual `MDX` files rather than using an OpenAPI specification. This method provides flexibility for custom content, but we recommend generating API documentation from an OpenAPI specification file for most API documentation projects as it's more maintainable and feature-rich. However, MDX can be useful for documenting small APIs, prototyping, or when you want to feature API endpoints alongside other content.

To generate pages for API endpoints using `MDX`, configure your API settings in `docs.json`, create individual `MDX` files for each endpoint, and use components like <ParamFields /> to define parameters. From these definitions, Mintlify generates interactive API playgrounds, request examples, and response examples.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your API">
    In your `docs.json` file, define your base URL and auth method:

    ```json
     "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "server": "https://mintlify.com/api", // string array for multiple base URLs
        "auth": {
          "method": "key",
          "name": "x-api-key" // options: bearer, basic, key.
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you would not like to show an API playground, you don't need to include auth types. Hide the playground with the following field:

    ```json
    "api": {
      "playground": {
        "display": "none"
      }
    }
    ```

    Find a full list of API configurations [here](settings#param-api).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create your endpoint pages">

    Each API endpoint page should have a corresponding MDX file. At the top of each file, define:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    ---
    ```

    You can specify path parameters by adding the parameter name to the path, wrapped with `{}`:

    ```bash
    https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
    ```

    <Note>

    If you have `server` configured in [docs.json](settings), you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.

    </Note>

    You can also override the globally-defined display mode for the API playground per page by adding `playground` at the top of the MDX file:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    playground: 'none'
    ```
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your endpoints to your docs">
    Add your endpoint pages to the sidebar by adding the paths to the `navigation` field in your `docs.json`. Learn more about structuring your docs [here](navigation).
