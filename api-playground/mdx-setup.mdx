title: "MDX setup"
description: "Generate docs pages for your API endpoints using `MDX`"
---

You can manually define API endpoints in individual `MDX` files rather than using an OpenAPI specification. We recommend generating API documentation from an OpenAPI specification file for most projects because it is more maintainable and feature-rich. However, creating `MDX` pages for an API can be useful to document small APIs or for prototyping.

## Setup

 and use [parameter and response fields](/components/fields) to define parameters and responses. From these definitions, Mintlify generates interactive API playgrounds, request examples, and response examples.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your API settings">
    In your `docs.json` file, define your base URL and authentication method:

    ```json
     "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "server": "https://mintlify.com/api", // string array for multiple base URLs
        "auth": {
          "method": "key",
          "name": "x-api-key" // options: bearer, basic, key.
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you want to hide the API playground, use the `display` field. You do not need to include an auth method if you hide the playground.

    ```json
    "api": {
      "playground": {
        "display": "none"
      }
    }
    ```

    Find a full list of API configurations in [Settings](/organize/settings#api-configurations).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create your endpoint pages">

    Each API endpoint page requires a corresponding `MDX` file. At the top of each file, define the `title` and `api`:

    ```mdx
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    ---
    ```

    Specify path parameters by adding the parameter name to the path, wrapped with `{}`:

    ```bash
    https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
    ```

    <Tip>
      If you have a `server` field configured in `docs.json`, you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.
    </Tip>

    To override the globally-defined display mode for the API playground on a specific page, add `playground` to the frontmatter:

    ```mdx
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    playground: 'none'
    ---
    ```

    - `playground: 'interactive'` - Display the interactive playground.
    - `playground: 'simple'` - Display a copyable endpoint with no playground.
    - `playground: 'none'` - Hide the playground.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add parameters and responses">
    Use [parameter and response fields](/components/fields) to define the parameters and return values of your API.

    ```mdx
    <ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
      Unique identifier for the user. Must be a valid UUID v4 format.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="email" type="string" required>
      User's email address. Must be valid and unique within the system.
    </ParamField>

    <ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
      Unique identifier assigned to the newly created user.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="email" type="string" required>
      The email address associated with this user account.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="created_at" type="timestamp">
      ISO 8601 formatted timestamp of when the user was created.
    </ResponseField>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your endpoints to your docs">
    Add your endpoint pages to the sidebar by adding the paths to the `navigation` field in your `docs.json`. Learn more about structuring your docs in [Navigation](/organize/navigation).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enabling authentication

You can add an authentication method to your `docs.json` to enable it globally on every page or you can set it on a per-page basis.

A page's authentication method will override a global method if both are set.

### Bearer token

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "bearer"
      }
    }
}
```

```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "bearer"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### Basic authentication

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "basic"
      }
    }
}
```

```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "basic"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### API key

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "key",
        "name": "x-api-key"
      }
    }
}
```

```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### None

The `none` authentication method is useful to disable authentication on a specific endpoint after setting a default in docs.json.

<CodeGroup>
```mdx Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "none"
---
```
</CodeGroup>
