## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To describe your endpoints with OpenAPI, make sure you have a valid OpenAPI
document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the
[OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). Your document must
follow OpenAPI specification 3.0+.

## OpenAPI File Formats

OpenAPI specifications can be written in either YAML or JSON format. Both formats are equally valid and contain the same information - choose the one that best fits your workflow.

### YAML Format

YAML is often preferred for its readability and concise syntax:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Sample API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of users
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: integer
                    name:
                      type: string
```

### JSON Format

JSON format is also widely used, especially when working with JavaScript tools:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "Sample API",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Returns a list of users",
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "Successful response",
            "content": {
              "application/json": {
                "schema": {
                  "type": "array",
                  "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "id": {
                        "type": "integer"
                      },
                      "name": {
                        "type": "string"
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Autogenerating the API playground

You can either [autogenerate the API playground](/settings/navigation#tabs) or
create MDX files for the individual OpenAPI endpoints.

### Auto-populate API pages

You can add an `openapi` field to an object in the `tabs` or `anchors` array in
the `mint.json`. This can either be with OpenAPI documents that are in the docs
repo (json or yaml) or hosted at a link.

**Example with Anchors:**

```json {5}
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example with Tabs:**

```json {6}
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create MDX files for OpenAPI endpoints

You can also create MDX files associated with each OpenAPI endpoint if you would
like to add additional context to specific pages or have more granular control
over the navigation. Here is
[the code](https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-docs/blob/e5e267c97b8d1e4c21db1dcdb8b005eb1dfed7da/api-reference/speech-to-speech.mdx?plain=1#L2)
from [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/speech-to-speech).

![](/images/elevenlabs-mdx-autogeneration-example.png)

If you want to autogenerate MDX files for every endpoint in your OpenAPI
document you can use our scraper.

#### Autogenerate files

Our Mintlify [scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping)
autogenerates MDX files for your OpenAPI endpoints. Use the relative path to the
OpenAPI document in your codebase. If you're using a publicly-hosted OpenAPI
document, you can supply the URL in place of a path.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file>
```

Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is
not specified, the files will populate in the working directory.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```

Learn more about our scraping package
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping).

The scraper will output an array of
[Navigation entries](/settings/global#structure) containing your OpenAPI MDX
files. You can either append these entries to your existing Navigation, or
reorder and add the files to your navigation manually.

<Note>
  If your OpenAPI document is invalid, the files will not autogenerate.
</Note>

#### Manually specify files

<Snippet file="api-playground/openapi.mdx" />

By using the OpenAPI reference, the name, description, parameters, responses,
and the API playground will be automatically generated using the specifications.

If you have multiple OpenAPI files, include the path to the OpenAPI file to map
the MDX file to the appropriate OpenAPI file. This is not required if you have
only one OpenAPI file - it will automatically detect your OpenAPI file.

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
title: "Get users"
openapi: "/path/to/openapi-1.json GET /users"
---
```

```md Format
---
title: "title of the page"
openapi: openapi-file-path method path
---
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
  The method endpoint must match the endpoint specified in the OpenAPI
  specifications exactly. If the endpoint doesn't exist in the OpenAPI file,
  the page will be empty.
</Note>

## Create MDX files for OpenAPI schemas

Mintlify also allows you to create individual pages for any OpenAPI schema
defined in an OpenAPI document's `components.schemas` field:

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
openapi-schema: OrderItem
---
```

```md Format
---
openapi-schema: "schema-key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>
