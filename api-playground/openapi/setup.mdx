## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To describe your endpoints with OpenAPI, make sure you have a valid OpenAPI document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). Your document must follow OpenAPI specification 3.0+.

There are two ways to configure your docs to use your OpenAPI file:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="In the repo" icon="github">
  The most common method of setting up OpenAPI with Mintlify is to add your OpenAPI documents directly to your docs repo. The format will either be in `.yaml` or `.json`. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="On the web" icon="globe">
  If you have a publicly-hosted OpenAPI document that serves as the single-source-of-truth for your API, you can use that in your docs through the document URL (ex: https://mintlify.com/specs/v2/openapi.json)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Autogenerating the API playground

You can either [autogenerate the API playground](/settings/navigation#tabs) or create MDX files for the individual OpenAPI endpoints.

### Auto-populate API pages

You can add an `openapi` field to an object in the `tabs` or `anchors` array in the `mint.json`. This can either be with OpenAPI documents that are in the docs repo or hosted at a link.

**Example with Anchors:**

```json 
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example with Tabs:**

```json 
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create MDX files for OpenAPI endpoints

You can also create MDX files associated with each OpenAPI endpoint if you would like to add additional context to specific pages. Check out an example from [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/speech-to-speech) below.

You can autogenerate these MDX files from your OpenAPI document using our scraper, or create each page manually.

#### Autogenerate files (Recommended)

Our Mintlify [scraper](/api-playground/openapi/setup#autogenerate-files-recommended) helps autogenerate MDX files for your OpenAPI endpoints. Use the relative path to the OpenAPI document in your codebase. If you're using a publicly-hosted OpenAPI document, you can just supply the URL in place of a path.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file>
```


Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is not specified, the files will populate into the current folder.

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```

Learn more about our scraping package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping).

The scraper will output an array of [Navigation entries](/settings/global#structure) containing your OpenAPI MDX files. You can either append these entries to your existing Navigation, or add the files to your Navigation manually.

<Note>
  If your OpenAPI document is invalid, the files will not autogenerate.
</Note>

#### Manually specify files

<Snippet file="api-playground/openapi.mdx" />

By using the OpenAPI reference, the name, description, parameters, responses, and the API playground will be automatically generated using the specifications.

If you have multiple OpenAPI files, include the name of the OpenAPI file (without the file type `.json` or `.yaml`) to correctly map the information.

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
title: "Get users"
openapi: "openapi-1 GET /users"
---
```

```md Format
---
title: "title of the page"
openapi: openapi-file-name method endpoint
---
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
  The method endpoint must match the endpoint specified in the OpenAPI
  specifications exactly. If the endpoint doesn't exist in the OpenAPI file,
  an empty page will be rendered.
</Note>

## Create MDX files for OpenAPI schemas

Mintlify also allows you to create individual pages for any OpenAPI schemas defined in an OpenAPI document's `components.schemas` field:

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
openapi-schema: OrderItem
---
```

```md Format
---
openapi-schema: "schema-key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>
