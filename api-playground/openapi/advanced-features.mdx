OpenAPI 3 has some advanced features for describing complex APIs. Here's how you can use them with Mintlify.

## `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`

For complex datatypes, OpenAPI provides the `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf` keywords, allowing you to combine schemas in certain ways. You can read more about these keywords in the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/), but essentially:

- `oneOf` functions like an "exclusive-or" operator
- `anyOf` functions like an "or" operator
- `allOf` functions like an "and" operator

<Warning>Mintlify treats the `oneOf` and `anyOf` keywords the same. We have found that, when people use `oneOf`, they often *mean* `anyOf` - and there is often no meaningful difference to the user.</Warning>

<Info>Mintlify currently does not support the `not` keyword.</Info>

### Combining schemas with `allOf`

Mintlify performs some preprocessing on your OpenAPI document to display these complex combinations in a readable way. For example, when you combine two object schemas with `allOf`, Mintlify combines the properties of both into a single object. This becomes especially useful when leveraging [OpenAPI's reusable `components`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/components/).

```yaml
org_with_users:
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Org'
    - type: object
      properties:
        users:
          type: array
          description: An array containing all users in the organization
...
components:
  schemas:
    Org:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: The ID of the organization
```

<ParamField body="org_with_users" type="object">
  <Expandable>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
      The ID of the organization
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="users" type="object[]">
      An array containing all users in the organization
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

### Providing options with `oneOf` and `anyOf`

When you use `oneOf` or `anyOf`, Mintlify displays the options in a tabbed container. To give your options helpful names, make sure to give each subschema a `title` field. For example, here's how you might display two different types of delivery addresses:

```yaml
delivery_address:
  oneOf:
    - title: StreetAddress
      type: object
      properties:
        address_line_1:
          type: string
          description: The street address of the recipient
        ...
    - title: POBox
      type: object
      properties:
        box_number:
          type: string
          description: The number of the PO Box
        ...
```

<ParamField body="delivery_address" type="object">
  <div className="mt-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-100 px-4 pb-4 pt-2 dark:border-white/10">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="StreetAddress">
        <ParamField body="address_line_1" type="string">
          The street address of the residence
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="POBox">
        <ParamField body="box_number" type="string">
          The number of the PO Box
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </div>
</ParamField>

## `x-codeSamples`

If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can add code samples to your OpenAPI document, and Mintlify will display them in your OpenAPI pages. You can define your code samples using the `x-codeSamples` extension. This property can be added within any request method, and has the following schema:

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The language of the code sample.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  The label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The source code of the sample.
</ParamField>

Here's an example of some code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```yaml
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```
