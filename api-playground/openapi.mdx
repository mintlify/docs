### Add an OpenAPI specification file

In order to reference OpenAPI, you must have the OpenAPI file in either a `json` or `yaml` format loaded into the docs folder. The name is irrelevant as long as the file follows [OpenAPI specifications](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### Reference OpenAPI endpoint

<Snippet file="api-playground/openapi.mdx" />

By using the OpenAPI reference, the name, description, parameters, responses, and the API playground will be automatically generated using the specifications.

<Note>
  The method endpoint must match the endpoint specified in the OpenAPI
  specifications exactly. Nothing is displayed if the endpoint doesn't exist in
  the OpenAPI file.
</Note>

### OpenAPI Schema

Generate a page that displays an OpenAPI schema which is defined in an OpenAPI spec's `components.schemas` map.

```md
---
openapi-schema: SchemaKey
---
```
