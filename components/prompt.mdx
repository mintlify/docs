Use prompts to display pre-built AI prompts that users can copy to their clipboard or open directly in Cursor. This component is ideal for sharing system prompts, instructions, or templates for AI assistants.

## Basic usage

<Prompt description="Use this pre-built prompt to get started faster.">
# Tailwind CSS Expert

You are a **Tailwind CSS expert**. Always use utility classes over custom CSS.  
**Rule #1:** Prefer `@apply` only in component layers — inline utilities everywhere else.  
**Rule #2:** Design tokens go in `tailwind.config.ts` — never hardcode colors or spacing.
</Prompt>
