Mintlify automatically serves static assets from your documentation repository at the appropriate path on your domain. For example, if you have `/images/my-logo.png` in your repo, the image file is available at `https://docs.your-project.com/images/my-logo.png`.

This works for any file type you want to make available to your users, including images, PDFs, videos, or schemas.

Files must be less than 20 MB for images and 100 MB for other file types.

## File organization

Organize your files using folders to keep your repository easy to navigate:

```text
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- images/
    |- logo.png
    |- screenshots/
      |- dashboard.png
  |- assets/
    |- whitepaper.pdf
    |- demo-video.mp4
```

Files are served from the root of your domain, so the structure in your repository directly maps to the URL structure. From the previous example, `assets/whitepaper.pdf` would be available at `https://docs.your-project.com/assets/whitepaper.pdf`.
