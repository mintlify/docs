Mintlify automatically serves static assets from your documentation repository, making it easy to include images, documents, and other files in your docs.

## Static asset serving

All static assets in your docs repository are automatically served at the appropriate path on your domain. For example, if you have `/images/my-logo.png` in your repo, the image will be available at `https://docs.yoursite.com/images/my-logo.png`.

This works for any file type - images, PDFs, videos, or other documents you want to make available to your users.

## File organization

Organize your files using folders to keep your repository clean:

```
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- images/
    |- logo.png
    |- screenshots/
      |- dashboard.png
  |- assets/
    |- whitepaper.pdf
    |- demo-video.mp4
```

Files are served from the root of your domain, so the structure in your repository directly maps to the URL structure.
