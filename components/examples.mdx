The `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` components display code blocks in the right sidebar to create a two-column layout that keeps examples visible while users scroll through your content. These components are designed for API documentation, but they work on all pages.

Common use cases:

- API endpoint documentation with request and response examples
- Configuration examples alongside explanatory text
- Code samples that users reference while following instructions
- Before and after examples in tutorials

On mobile devices, `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` components display as regular code blocks and can be scrolled past.

## RequestExample

Use `<RequestExample>` to pins code examples in the right sidebar. This component works similarly to the [CodeGroup](/components/code-groups) component, but displays the code in the sidebar instead of inline.

You can include multiple code blocks inside a single `<RequestExample>`. Each code block must have a title attribute.

````mdx RequestExample
<RequestExample>

```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://dog-api.kinduff.com/api/facts
```

</RequestExample>
````

## ResponseExample

The `<ResponseExample>` component pins code examples in the right sidebar beneath any `<RequestExample>` content on the same page.

````mdx ResponseExample
<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{ "status": "success" }
```

</ResponseExample>
````
