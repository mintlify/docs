Use cards to create visual containers for content. Cards are flexible containers that can include text, icons, images, and links.

## Basic card

<Card title="Card title" icon="text" href="/components/columns">
  This is how you use a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card
  brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>

```mdx Card example
<Card title="Card title" icon="text" href="/components/columns">
  This is how you use a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card
  brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>
```

## Card variations

Cards support several layout and styling options to fit different content needs.

### Horizontal layout

Add the `horizontal` property to display cards in a more compact, horizontal layout.

<Card title="Horizontal card" icon="text" horizontal>
  This is an example of a horizontal card.
</Card>

```mdx Horizontal card example
<Card title="Horizontal card" icon="text" horizontal>
  This is an example of a horizontal card.
</Card>
```

### Image cards

Add an `img` property to display an image at the top of the card.

<Card title="Image card" img="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/yosemite.jpg">
  This is an example of a card with an image.
</Card>

```mdx Image card example
<Card title="Image card" img="/images/card-with-image.png">
  This is an example of a card with an image.
</Card>
```

### Link cards with custom CTAs

You can customize the call-to-action text and control whether an arrow appears. By default, arrows only show for external links.

<Card title="Link card" icon="link" href="/components/columns" arrow="true" cta="Click here">
  This is an example of a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>

```mdx Link card example
<Card
  title="Link card"
  icon="link"
  href="/components/columns"
  arrow="true"
  cta="Click here"
>
  This is an example of a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>
```

## Grouping cards

Use the [Columns component](/components/columns) to organize multiple cards side by side.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="First card" icon="panel-left-close">
    This is the first card.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second card" icon="panel-right-close">
    This is the second card.
  </Card>
</Columns>

```mdx Columns example
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="First card" icon="panel-left-close">
    This is the first card.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second card" icon="panel-right-close">
    This is the second card.
  </Card>
</Columns>
```
