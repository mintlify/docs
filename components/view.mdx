Use the `View` component to create content that changes based on the selected view in a multi-view dropdown. This is particularly useful for showing code examples or documentation specific to different programming languages or frameworks.

<Tip>
  Use one view component per language per page. Use [tabs](/components/tabs) for procedures that differ by language and [code groups](/components/code-groups) for code examples that differ by language.
</Tip>

<View title="JavaScript" icon="js">
  This content is only visible when JavaScript is selected.

  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
  ```
</View>

<View title="Python" icon="python">
  This content is only visible when Python is selected.

  ```python
  print("Hello from Python!")
  ```
</View>

## Example

````mdx JavaScript and Python views
<View title="JavaScript" icon="js">
  This content is only visible when JavaScript is selected.

  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
  ```
</View>

<View title="Python" icon="python">
  This content is only visible when Python is selected.

  ```python
  print("Hello from Python!")
  ```
</View>
````

## Table of contents behavior

The table of contents automatically updates to show only the headings for the currently selected view. When you switch between views using the multi-view dropdown, the table of contents refreshes to display the relevant headings for that view.

If you have different heading structures in each view, users will only see the headings that are relevant to their selected language or framework.
