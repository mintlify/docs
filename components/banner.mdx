Use banners to display important announcements, updates, or notifications across your entire documentation site. Banners appear at the top of every page, support Markdown formatting, and can be made dismissible. Banners use the color defined by the `colors.dark` property in your `docs.json`.

To add a banner, use the `banner` property in your `docs.json`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Product announcements wrap
  "banner": {
    "content": "🚀 Version 2.0 is now live! See our [changelog](/changelog) for details.",
    "dismissible": true 
  }
  ```

  ```json Maintenance notices wrap
  "banner": {
    "content": "⚠️ Scheduled maintenance: API will be unavailable December 15, 2-4 AM UTC",
    "dismissible": false
  }
  ```

  ```json Required actions wrap
  "banner": {
    "content": "**Action required:** Migrate to our new version by January 1. [Migration guide](/migration)",
    "dismissible": true
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
