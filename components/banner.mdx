Use banners to display important announcements, updates, or notifications across your entire documentation site. Banners appear at the top of every page and support Markdown formatting.

## Configuration

Add a banner to your `docs.json` file. The banner supports Markdown formatting and can be made dismissible:

```json
{
  "banner": {
    "content": "🚀 **New feature released!** [Check out our latest updates](/changelog)",
    "dismissible": true
  }
}
```

When `dismissible` is `true`, users can close the banner and it won't reappear for their session.

## Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Product announcements">
    ```json
    {
      "banner": {
        "content": "🚀 Version 2.0 is now live! [See what's new](/changelog)",
        "dismissible": true
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Maintenance notices">
    ```json
    {
      "banner": {
        "content": "⚠️ Scheduled maintenance: API will be unavailable Dec 15, 2-4 AM UTC",
        "dismissible": false
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Migration alerts">
    ```json
    {
      "banner": {
        "content": "📋 **Action required:** Migrate to our new API by Jan 1st. [Migration guide](/migration)",
        "dismissible": true
      }
    }
    ```
