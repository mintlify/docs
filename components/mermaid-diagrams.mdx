[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) lets you build flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and other diagrams using text and code.

For a complete list of supported diagram types and syntax, see the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

````mdx Mermaid flowchart example
```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```

## Syntax

To create a Mermaid diagram, write your diagram definition inside a Mermaid code block.

````mdx
```mermaid
// Your mermaid diagram code here
```
````
