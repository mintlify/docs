[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) lets you build flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and other diagrams using text and code.

For a complete list of supported diagram types and syntax, see the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

```mermaid
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```

````mdx Mermaid flowchart example

```

## Interactive controls

All Mermaid diagrams include interactive zoom and pan controls. By default, controls appear when the diagram height exceeds 120px.

- **Zoom in/out**: Use the zoom buttons to increase or decrease the diagram scale.
- **Pan**: Use the directional arrows to move around the diagram.
- **Reset view**: Click the reset button to return to the original view.

The controls are especially useful for large or complex diagrams that don't fit entirely in the viewport.

## Properties

You can customize the behavior and appearance of Mermaid diagrams using props.

<ResponseField name="actions" type="boolean">
  Show or hide the interactive controls. When set, this overrides the default behavior (controls shown when diagram height exceeds 120px).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="placement" type="string">
  Position of the interactive controls. Options: `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`. Defaults to `bottom-right`.
</ResponseField>

### Examples

Hide controls on a diagram:

````mdx
```mermaid actions={false}
flowchart LR
    A --> B
```
````

Show controls in the top-left corner:

````mdx
```mermaid placement="top-left"
flowchart LR
    A --> B
```
````

Combine both properties:

````mdx
```mermaid placement="top-left" actions={true}
flowchart LR
    A --> B
```
````

## Syntax

To create a Mermaid diagram, write your diagram definition inside a Mermaid code block.

````mdx
```mermaid
// Your mermaid diagram code here
```
````
