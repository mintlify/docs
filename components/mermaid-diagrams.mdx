[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) lets you build flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and other diagrams using text and code.

For a complete list of supported diagram types and syntax, see the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

```mermaid placement="top-right"
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end
    %% ^ These subgraphs are identical, except for the links to them:

    %% Link *to* subgraph1: subgraph1 direction is maintained
    outside --> subgraph1
    %% Link *within* subgraph2:
    %% subgraph2 inherits the direction of the top-level graph (LR)
    outside ---> top2
```

````mdx Mermaid flowchart example
```mermaid placement="top-right"
  flowchart LR
    subgraph subgraph1
        direction TB
        top1[top] --> bottom1[bottom]
    end
    subgraph subgraph2
        direction TB
        top2[top] --> bottom2[bottom]
    end

```

## ELK layout support

Mintlify supports the [ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel)](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/) layout engine for Mermaid diagrams. ELK optimizes arrangement to reduce overlapping and improve readability, which is useful for large or complex diagrams.

To use ELK layout in your Mermaid diagrams, add the `%%{init: {'flowchart': {'defaultRenderer': 'elk'}}}%%` directive at the beginning of your diagram:

````mdx ELK layout example
```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart': {'defaultRenderer': 'elk'}}}%%
flowchart LR
    A[Start] --> B[Process 1]
    B --> C[Process 2]
    B --> D[Process 3]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E
```
````

## Interactive controls

All Mermaid diagrams include interactive zoom and pan controls. By default, controls appear when the diagram height exceeds 120px.

- **Zoom in/out**: Use the zoom buttons to increase or decrease the diagram scale.
- **Pan**: Use the directional arrows to move around the diagram.
- **Reset view**: Click the reset button to return to the original view.

The controls are especially useful for large or complex diagrams that don't fit entirely in the viewport.

## Properties

<ResponseField name="actions" type="boolean">
  Show or hide the interactive controls. When set, this overrides the default behavior (controls shown when diagram height exceeds 120px).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="placement" type="string" default="bottom-right">
  Position of the interactive controls. Options: `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`.
</ResponseField>

### Examples

Hide controls on a diagram:

````mdx
```mermaid actions={false}
flowchart LR
    A --> B
```
````

Show controls in the top-left corner:

````mdx
```mermaid placement="top-left"
flowchart LR
    A --> B
```
````

Combine both properties:

````mdx
```mermaid placement="top-left" actions={true}
flowchart LR
    A --> B
```
````

## Syntax

To create a Mermaid diagram, write your diagram definition inside a Mermaid code block.

````mdx
```mermaid
// Your mermaid diagram code here
```
````
