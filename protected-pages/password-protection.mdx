TODO: add a description of when and why you'd use password protection

## Prerequisites

* Your security requirements allow sharing passwords among users.

## Implementation

TODO: verify steps with new UI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a password.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Protected pages](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Password**.
    3. Enter a secure password.
    4. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Distribute access.">
    Securely share the password and documentation URL with authorized users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example scenario

You need basic access control without tracking individual users. You want to prevent public access while keeping setup simple. Your user base is small and trusted, so you can share a single password with all users.

**Create a strong password** in your dashboard. **Share credentials** with authorized users. Rotate the password regularly and you are all set.
