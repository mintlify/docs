Select the handshake method that you want to configure.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JWT">
### Prerequisites

* An authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs.
* A backend service that can create redirect URLs.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **JWT**.
    4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
    5. Select **Generate new key**.
    6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate Mintlify authentication into your login flow.">
    Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user authentication:
    
    * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/protected-pages/sending-data) for more information.
    * Sign the JWT with your secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm.
    * Create a redirect URL back to the `/login/jwt-callback` path of your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` with an existing authentication system at `foo.com`. You want to extend your login flow to grant access to the docs while keeping your docs separate from your dashboard (or you don't have a dashboard).

Create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that extends your existing authentication.

After verifying user credentials:
* Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
* Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000), // 2 week session expiration
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    content: {
      firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
      lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s') // 10 second JWT expiration
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#${jwt}`);
}
```

```python Python
import jwt # pyjwt
import os

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

private_key = os.getenv(MINTLIFY_JWT_PEM_SECRET_NAME, '')

@router.get('/auth')
async def return_mintlify_auth_status(current_user):
  jwt_token = jwt.encode(
    payload={
      'exp': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)).timestamp()),    # 10 second JWT expiration
      'expiresAt': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)).timestamp()), # 1 week session expiration
      'groups': ['admin'] if current_user.is_admin else [],
      'content': {
        'firstName': current_user.first_name,
        'lastName': current_user.last_name,
      },
    },
    key=private_key,
    algorithm='EdDSA'
  )

  return RedirectResponse(url=f'https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{jwt_token}', status_code=302)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Redirecting unauthenticated users

When an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, their intended destination is preserved in the redirect to your login URL:

1. User attempts to visit a protected page: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart`.
2. Redirect to your login URL with a redirect query parameter: `https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart`.
3. After authentication, redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback?redirect=%2Fquickstart#{SIGNED_JWT}`.
4. User lands in their original destination.

<Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
### Prerequisites

* An OAuth server that supports the Authorization Code Flow.
* Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens (optional, to enable API prefilling features).

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth settings.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **OAuth** and configure these fields:
      * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth endpoint.
      * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
      * **Client Secret**: Your OAuth 2.0 client secret.
      * **Scopes**: Permissions to request. Use multiple scopes if you need different access levels.
      * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
      * **Info API URL** (optional): Endpoint to retrieve user info for API prefilling. If omitted, the OAuth flow will only be used to verify identity and the user info will be empty.
    4. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
    1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Add the redirect URL as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your user info endpoint (optional).">
    To enable API playground prefilling, create an API endpoint that:
    * Accepts OAuth access tokens for authentication.
    * Returns user data in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/protected-pages/sending-data) for more information.
    
    Add this endpoint URL to the **Info API URL** field in your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `foo.com/docs` and you have an existing OAuth server at `auth.foo.com` that supports the Authorization Code Flow.

**Configure your OAuth server details** in your dashboard:
- **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
- **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
- **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
- **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
- **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

**Create a user info endpoint** at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`, which requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope, and returns:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "groups": ["engineering", "admin"]
}
```

**Configure your OAuth server to allow redirects** to your callback URL.

<Tab title="Mintlify Dashboard">
### Prerequisites

* Your documentation users are also your documentation editors.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Mintlify dashboard authentication.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **Mintlify Auth**.
    4. Select **Enable Mintlify Auth**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add authorized users.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Members](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
    2. Add each person who should have access to your documentation.
    3. Assign appropriate roles based on their editing permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` and your team uses the dashboard to edit your docs. You want to restrict access to team members only.

**Enable Mintlify authentication** in your dashboard settings.

**Verify team access** by checking that all team members are added to your organization.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Shared session">
### Prerequisites
TODO: verify this is still an option

* A dashboard or user portal with cookie-based session authentication.
* Ability to create an API endpoint at the same origin or subdomain as your dashboard.
  * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
  * If your dashboard is at `dash.foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `dash.foo.com` or `*.dash.foo.com`.
* Your docs are hosted at the same domain or subdomain as your dashboard.
  * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
  * If your dashboard is at `*.foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create user info API endpoint.">
    Create an API endpoint that:
    * Uses your existing session authentication to identify users
    * Returns user data in the `User` format (see [Sending Data](/protected-pages/sending-data))
    * If the API domain and the docs domain **do not exactly match**:
      * Add the docs domain to your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (must not be `*`).
      * Set your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`.
    
      <Warning>
        Only enable CORS headers on this specific endpoint, not your entire dashboard API.
      </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your settings.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Personalization**.
    3. Select **Shared Session**.
    4. Enter your **Info API URL**, which is the endpoint from the first step.
    5. Enter your **Login URL**, where users log into your dashboard.
    6. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

#### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at subdomain

You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://docs.foo.com`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

#### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at root

You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://foo.com`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

#### Dashboard at root, docs at root

You have a dashboard at `foo.com/dashboard`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://foo.com/api/docs/user-info`

<Note>
No CORS configuration is needed since the dashboard and docs share the same domain.
