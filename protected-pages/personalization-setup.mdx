Personalization lets you customize your documentation based on user information. This guide covers setup for each available handshake method.

**Need help choosing?** See the [overview](/authentication-personalization/overview) to compare options.

## Configuring personalization

Select the handshake method that you want to configure.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JWT">
### Prerequisites

* A login system that can generate and sign JWTs.
* A backend service that can create redirect URLs.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Personalization**.
    3. Select **JWT**.
    4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
    5. Select **Generate new key**.
    6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate Mintlify personalization into your login flow.">
    Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user login:
    
    * Create a JWT containing the logged in user's info in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.
    * Sign the JWT with the secret key, using the ES256 algorithm.
    * Create a redirect URL back to your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com`. You want your docs to be separate from your dashboard (or you don't have a dashboard) and enable personalization.

Generate a JWT secret. Then create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that initiates a login flow to your documentation.

After verifying user credentials:
* Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
* Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

```ts
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'ES256');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000),
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    content: {
      firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
      lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'ES256' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s')
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com#${jwt}`);
}
```

### Preserving page anchors

To redirect users to specific sections after login, use this URL format: `https://docs.foo.com/page#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor={ANCHOR}`.

**Example**:
* Original URL: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#step-one`
* Redirect URL: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor=step-one`

<Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
### Prerequisites
* An OAuth server that supports the Auth Code with PKCE Flow.
* Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens.

### Implementation
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create user info API endpoint.">
    Create an API endpoint that:
    * Accepts OAuth access tokens for authentication.
    * Returns user data in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.
    * Defines the scopes for access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth personalization settings.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Personalization**.
    3. Select **OAuth** and configure these fields:
      * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth authorization endpoint.
      * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
      * **Scopes**: Permissions to request. Must match the scopes of the endpoint that you configured in the first step.
      * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
      * **Info API URL**: Endpoint to retrieve user data for personalization. Created in the first step.
    4. Select **Save changes**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
    1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Add this URL as an authorized redirect URL in your OAuth server configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `foo.com/docs` and you have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE flow. You want to personalize your docs based on user data.

**Create a user info endpoint** at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`, which requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope and responds with the user's custom data:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "groups": ["engineering", "admin"]
}
```

**Configure your OAuth server details** in your dashboard:
* **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
* **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
* **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
* **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
* **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

**Configure your OAuth server** to allow redirects to your callback URL.
  </Tab>
<Tab title="Shared session">
### Prerequisites

* A dashboard or user portal with cookie-based session authentication.
* Ability to create an API endpoint at the same origin or subdomain as your dashboard.
  * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
  * If your dashboard is at `dash.foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `dash.foo.com` or `*.dash.foo.com`.
* Your docs are hosted at the same domain or subdomain as your dashboard.
  * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
  * If your dashboard is at `*.foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create user info API endpoint.">
    Create an API endpoint that:
    * Uses your existing session authentication to identify users
    * Returns user data in the `User` format (see [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data))
    * If the API domain and the docs domain **do not exactly match**:
      * Add the docs domain to your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (must not be `*`).
      * Set your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`.
    
      <Warning>
        Only enable CORS headers on this specific endpoint, not your entire dashboard API.
      </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your personalization settings">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Personalization**.
    3. Select **Shared Session**.
    4. Enter your **Info API URL**, which is the endpoint from the first step.
    5. Enter your **Login URL**, where users log into your dashboard.
    6. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

#### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at subdomain

You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://docs.foo.com`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

#### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at root

You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://foo.com`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

#### Dashboard at root, docs at root

You have a dashboard at `foo.com/dashboard`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://foo.com/api/docs/user-info`

<Note>
No CORS configuration is needed since the dashboard and docs share the same domain.
