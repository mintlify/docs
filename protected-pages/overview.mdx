<Info>
  Authentication methods are available on the [Growth and Enterprise
  plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication).
</Info>

Choose how users authenticate to access your documentation.

You can make all of your content private or control access on a page-by-page basis.

## Authentication methods

Choose between simple shared password access or individual user authentication based on your security needs.

### Password protection

Shared access with a single global password.

- Pros of password protection:
  - Simple setup with no configuration required to add new users. Just share the password.
- Cons of password protection:
  - Cannot differentiate between users with the same password.
  - Must change the password to revoke access.

### Identity provider authentication

Authenticate individual users with one of the following methods.

**JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Custom system where you manage user tokens with full control over the login flow.
- Pros of JWT:
  - Reduced risk of API endpoint abuse.
  - No CORS configuration.
  - No restrictions on API URLs.
- Cons of JWT:
  - Must be compatible with your existing login flow.
  - Users log into your dashboard and docs separately.

**OAuth 2.0**: Third-party login integration like Google, GitHub, or other OAuth providers.

- Pros of OAuth 2.0:
  - Heightened security standard.
  - No restrictions on API URLs.
- Cons of OAuth 2.0:
  - Requires significant work if setting up an OAuth server for the first time.
  - Users log into your dashboard and docs separately.

**Mintlify dashboard**: Allow all of your dashboard users to access your docs.

- Pros of Mintlify dashboard:
  - No configuration required.
  - Enables private preview deployments, restricting access to authenticated users only.
- Cons of Mintlify dashboard:
  - Requires all users of your docs to have an account in your Mintlify dashboard.

## Choose your method

**Use password protection if**:

- You want a simple, quick setup.
- All authorized users can share the same password.
- You don't need to track individual users.

**Use identity provider authentication if**:

- You need to identify individual users.
- You want to integrate with existing login flows.
