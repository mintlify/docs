<Info>
  Authentication methods are available on the [Growth and Enterprise
  plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication).
</Info>

Restrict access to your documentation with a password or with a third-party authentication provider.

You can make all of your content private or control access on a page-by-page basis.

## Handshake methods

**JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Custom system where you manage user tokens with full control over the login flow.

- Pros of JWT:
  - Reduced risk of API endpoint abuse.
  - No CORS configuration.
  - No restrictions on API URLs.
- Cons of JWT:
  - Must be compatible with your existing login flow.
  - Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are decoupled, so your team will log into your dashboard and your docs separately.
  - When you refresh user data, users must log into your docs again. If your users' data changes frequently, they must log in frequently or risk having stale data in your docs.

**OAuth 2.0**: Third-party login integration like Google, GitHub, or other OAuth providers.

- Pros of OAuth 2.0:
  - Heightened security standard.
  - No restrictions on API URLs.
- Cons of OAuth 2.0:
  - Requires significant work if setting up an OAuth server for the first time.
  - Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are decoupled, so your team will log into your dashboard and your docs separately.

**Mintlify dashboard**: Allow all of your dashboard users to access your docs.

- Pros of Mintlify dashboard:
  - No configuration required.
  - Enables private preview deployments, restricting access to authenticated users only.
- Cons of Mintlify dashboard:
  - Requires all users of your docs to have an account in your Mintlify dashboard.

**Password**: Shared access with a single global password. Used for access control only. Does not allow for personalization.

- Pros of password:
  - Simple setup with no configuration required to add new users, just share the password.
- Cons of password:
  - Lose personalization features since there is no way to differentiate users with the same password.
  - Must change the password to revoke access.
