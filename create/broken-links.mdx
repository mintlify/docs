Broken links frustrate users and hurt your documentation's credibility. Use the CLI or CI checks to find and fix broken links before they reach production.

## Check for broken links locally

Run the link checker from your documentation directory:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

The command scans all pages and reports any internal links that point to non-existent pages or anchors.

### Example output

```text
Found 2 broken links:

/quickstart.mdx
  Line 15: /getting-started/installation → Page not found

/api/authentication.mdx
  Line 42: /api/overview#api-keys → Anchor not found
```

### Ignored files

The link checker ignores files matching patterns in your [.mintignore](/organize/mintignore) file. Links that point to ignored files are reported as broken because those pages won't exist in your published documentation.

## CI checks

<Info>
  CI checks for broken links are available on [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=docs-broken-links).
</Info>

Enable automatic broken link checks on pull requests by configuring CI checks in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons). The CI check runs the same link checker as the CLI and reports results directly in GitHub.

See [CI checks](/deploy/ci#broken-links) for configuration details.

## Common causes

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Renamed or moved pages | Add a [redirect](/create/redirects) and update internal links |
| Typos in link paths | Correct the path to match the actual file location |
| Deleted pages | Remove links to the page or restore the content |
| Missing anchor | Add the header or remove the anchor from the link |
| Files in .mintignore | Remove from .mintignore or update links to point elsewhere |

## Fix broken links

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the link checker">
    ```bash

  <Step title="Review the output">
    Each broken link shows the source file, line number, and the broken path.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fix each link">
    Update the link path, add a redirect, or remove the link if the content no longer exists.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the fix">
    Run `mint broken-links` again to confirm all links resolve correctly.
