When you change the path of a file in your docs folder, it also changes the URL path to that page. This may happen when restructuring your docs or changing the sidebar title.

## Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field to your `docs.json` file.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/source/path",
    "destination": "/destination/path"
  }
]
```

This permanently redirects `/source/path` to `/destination/path` so that you don't lose any previous SEO for the original page.

### Wildcard redirects

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` matches `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/beta/:slug*",
    "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
  }
]
```

### Partial wildcard redirects

Use partial wildcards to match URL segments that start with a specific prefix. The pattern `prefix-*` matches any segment beginning with `prefix-` and captures the remaining portion.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/en/articles/9140627-*",
    "destination": "/collections/overview"
  }
]
```

This matches URLs like `/en/articles/9140627-how-to-create-collections` and `/en/articles/9140627-managing-collections`, redirecting them all to `/collections/overview`.

You can also substitute the captured portion in the destination:

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/old/article-*",
    "destination": "/new/article-*"
  }
]
```

This redirects `/old/article-123` to `/new/article-123`, preserving the captured value after the prefix.

<Warning>
  The destination slug cannot match to the source slug. For example, if your docs are hosted at `/docs`, avoid:
  ```json
  {
    "source": "/docs/:slug*",
    "destination": "/:slug*"
  }
  ```
</Warning>

## Broken links

Catch broken links with our CLI. [Install the CLI](/installation) and run the command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

The CLI identifies any relative links in your docs that don't exist.
