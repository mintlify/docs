When you change the path of a file in your docs folder, it also changes the URL path to that page. This may happen when restructuring your docs or changing the sidebar title.

## Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field to your `docs.json` file.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/source/path",
    "destination": "/destination/path"
  }
]
```

This permanently redirects `/source/path` to `/destination/path` so that you don't lose any previous SEO for the original page.

### Wildcard redirects

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` matches `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/beta/:slug*",
    "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
  }
]
```

### Partial wildcard redirects

Use partial wildcards to match URL segments that start with a specific prefix.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/articles/concepts-*",
    "destination": "/collections/overview"
  }
]
```

This matches any URLs with the `/articles/concepts-` path, such as `/articles/concepts-getting-started` and `/articles/concepts-overview`, and redirects them all to `/collections/overview`.

You can also substitute the captured wildcard value in the destination.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/old/article-*",
    "destination": "/new/article-*"
  }
]
```

This redirects `/old/article-123` to `/new/article-123`, preserving the captured value after the prefix.

### Avoid infinite redirects

To avoid infinite loops, do not create circular redirects where paths redirect back to each other.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/docs/:slug*",
    "destination": "/help/:slug*"
  },
  {
    "source": "/help/:slug*",
    "destination": "/docs/:slug*"
  }
]
```

## Check for broken links

Find broken links with the [CLI](/installation).

```bash
mint broken-links
```
